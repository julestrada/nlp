Center will soon seek a California legislator to author a bill in 2013 to reduce legal barriers to the cultivation and sale of homegrown and locallygrown produce We have posted a summary of the bill here in order to seek feedback ¬†Please post a comment letting us know your thoughts on the proposal below or email JanelleSELC at gmailcom with your questions and comments Thank youPurposes and SummaryThe purposes of the California Homegrown Food Act are to1 Increase access to fresh locally sourced produce for all Californians regardless of location and other socioeconomic limitations2 Allow individuals to supplement their incomes through sale of produce grown at home or on other urban or suburban land and3 Reduce the carbon footprint of our food system by enabling the increased cultivation of produce in or near places it is consumedThe Act will achieve these purposes by ensuring the rights of individuals and groups to cultivate and in certain cases sell edible plants The Act will remove a handful of barriers arising from local zoning laws private land covenants and lease restrictions ¬†Producers must however still comply with any and all relevant health agricultural and environmental regulations ¬†The Act will specify the types of allowable food production practices and basis for regulation by defining three types of food growing activities and specifying reasonable limits and regulations thereofFindings and DeclarationsThe Legislature finds and declares all of the followinga California industrial agriculture is at risk due to water shortages soil degradation pollution environmental and structural threats to the San Francisco Bay Delta and the rising cost of oil ¬†A food shortage from these problems is a real and imminent threat Providing Californians with the capacity to feed themselves and their communities would drastically improve local food security and mediate the risks of ¬†water soil environmental or fuelrelated crisesb Though California is the bread basket of the United States and has regions of climate and land ideal for agriculture a significant amount of Californias food is grown hundreds or thousands of miles from where it is consumed This results in high transportation costs energy consumption and lost economic opportunity for our state Even food grown in the heart of Californias farming region is expensive to disperse to the rest of the state due to rising fuel costsc California is no exception to rising US obesity and obesityrelated diseases ¬†It is important to note that1 Twothirds of American adults and nearly onethird of American children are obese or overweight putting them at risk for developing chronic diseases such as diabetes heart disease or cancer2 One in every nine California children one in three teens and over half of adults are already overweight or obese This epidemic affects virtually all Californians3 These health conditions are preventable and curable through lifestyle choices that include

Harris Los Angeles Conservation Corps Updated March 2001 by Yvonne Savio Common Ground Garden Program Manager UCCE  This Community Garden StartUp Guide is intended to help neighborhood groups and organizations along the path to starting and sustaining a community garden Why Start a Community Garden   Many families living in the city would like to grow some of their own fruits vegetables herbs and flowers  Some want to sa ve money on their food bills  Others like the freshness flavor an d wholesomeness of homegrown produce  And for many gardening  is a relaxing way to exercise and enjoy being outofdoors  There are also families from other cultures who would like to grow traditional foods not available in the supermarket   Community gardens beautify neighborhoods and help bring neighbors closer together  They have been proven as tools to reduce neighborhood crimeparticularly when vacant blighted lots are targeted for garden development  Community gardens provide saf e recreational green space in urban areas with little or no park land and can contribute greatly  to keeping urban air clean   Those who are lucky enough to have sunny backyards or balconies can plant a garden whenever they  have the time and energy  But what about those who do not have a place to garden  For these people community gardens may be the answer  Step by Step To Your Own Community Garden  1 Get Your Neighbors Involved  There is a lot of work involved in starting a new garden  Make  sure you have several people who will help you  Over the years  our experience indicates that there should be at least ten interested families to cr eate and sustain a garden project  Survey the residents of your neighborhood to see if they are interested and would participate  Hold monthly meetings of the interested group to develo p and initiate plans keep people posted on the gardens progress and keep them involved in the process from day one  2 Form a Garden Club  A garden club is a way of formally organizing your new group  It helps you make decisions and divideup the work effectively  It also ensures that every one has a vested interest in the garden and can contribute to its design development and maintenance   It can be formed at any time during the process of  starting a community garden however its wi se to do so early on  This way club members can share in the many tasks of establishing the new gard en  The typical garden club will have many functions includin g  Establishing garden rules see sample  Accepting and reviewing garden applications  Making plot assignments  Collecting garden dues if any  Paying water bills  Resolving conflicts The typical garden club has at least two officers  a president and a treasurer although your garden club may have more if nec essary  Elections for garden officers usually are held annually     2Find Land for the Garden  Look around your neighbor hood for a vacant lo t that gets plenty of sunat least six to  eight hours each day  A garden site sh ould be relatively flat although slight slopes ca n be terraced  It should be relatively fr ee of large pieces of concrete left behind  from demolition of structures  Any rubble or debris should be manageablethat is it can be removed by volunteers clearing the lot  with trash bags wheelbarrows and pick up trucks  Ideally it should have a fence around it with a gate wide enough for a vehicle to enter  It is possible to work with a site that is paved with  concrete or asphalt by building raised beds that sit on the surfa ce or using containers  You can also remove the asphalt or concrete to cr eate areas for gardens but such a garden will be much more diffi cult expensive and timeconsuming to start  A site without pa ving and soil relatively free of trash and debris is best  The potential garden site should be within walking or no more  than a short drive from you and the neighbors who have expressed  interest in participating  If the lot is not already being used  make sure the community supports establishing a garden there   Its best to select three potential sites in your neighborhood and write down their address and ne arest cross streets  If you dont know the address of a vacant lot get the addresses of the properti es on both sides of the lotthis will give you the ability to ma ke an educated guess on the address of the site  We suggest you identify at least three potential sites b ecause one or more might no t be available for you to use for various reasons and you want to end up with at least one that works out  3 Find out Who Owns the Land  It is illegal to use land without obtaining the owners permission  In order to obtain permission you must first find out who owns the land  Take the information you have written down about the location of th e sites in step 3 to your countys tax assessors office  T he Los Angeles County Tax Assessors office is located at 225 North Hill Street Room 205  Or go to a branch office listed in the whi te pages of the telephone directory  At this office you will look  through the map books to get the names and addresses of the ow ner of the sites you are interested in  4 Find out if Your Proposed Site has Water  While you are researching site ownership contact the water servi ce provider in your area to fi nd out if your potential sites  hashave an existing water meter to hookin to  Call your water providers customer service department and ask them to conduc t a site investigation  They will need the same location inform ation that you took with you to the Tax Asse ssors office  Existing access to water will make a critical difference in the expense of getting your project started  Depending on the size  of your garden site you will need a 12inch to 1inch water meter  If there has been water service to the site in the past it is re latively inexpensive to get a new water meter installed if one doesnt al ready exist  If there has never been water service to that s ite it might cost much more for your water provider to install a lateral line from the street main to the site and install your new me ter  5 Contact the Land Owner  Once you have determined that your potential site is feasible write a letter to the landowner asking for permission to use the  property for a community garden  Be sure to mention to the landowner the value of the garden to the community and the fact the  gardeners will be responsible for keeping the site clean and weed free this saves landowners from maintaining the site or payi ng city weed abatement fees  Establish a term for use of the site and prepare and negotiate a lease  Typically groups lease garden sites from land owners  for 1 per year  You should attempt to negotiate a lease for a least thr ee years or longer if the proper ty owner is agreeable  Man y landowners are worried about their liability for injuries that mi ght occur at the garden  Therefore you should include a simp le hold harmless waiver in the lease and in gardener agreement forms  For more information on the lease and the hold harmless waiver  see 8 Signing a Lease  Be prepared to purchase liability insuran ce to protect further the property owner and  yourself should an accident occur at th e garden  For more information on the hold harmless waiver and liability insurance see 8 Signing a Lease and 9 Obtaining  Liability Insurance  6 Get Your Soil Tested  It might be advisable to have the soil at the site tested for fertility pH and presence of hea vy metals  Contact a private lab   7 Signing a Lease  Landowners of potential garden sites might be concerned abou t their liability should someone be injured while working in the garden  Your group should be prepared to offer the landowner a lease with a hold harmless waiver  This hold harmless waiv er can simply state that should one of the ga rdeners be injured as a result of negligence  on the part of another gardener the lan downer is held harmless and will not be sued  Each gardener should be made aware of this waiver and sh ould be required to sign an  3agreement in order to obtain a plot in the community garden  A sample gardener agreement form is attached which your group can use as a model  8 Obtaining Liability Insurance  Landowners may also require that your group purchase liabilit y insurance  Community gardeners in the Los Angeles area can obtain inexpensive policies from Metro Farm Gardens  Contact Toby Leaman at 323 6637441 or fax 323 6635715 for more information on obtaining an insurance policy  Once you have a lease signed by the landowner and liability insurance youre free to plan and plant your garden  9 Planning the Garden  Community members should be involved in the planning design and setup of the garden  Before the design process begins you should measure your site and make a simple toscale site map  Hold two or three garden design meetings at times when interest ed participants can attend  Make sure that group decisions are re corded in official minutes or that someone takes accurate notes   This ensures that decisions made can be communicated to others and progress will not be slowed  A great way to generate ideas and visualize the design is to use simple drawings or photos cut from garden magazines representing the different garden components flower beds compost bins pathways arbors etcthat can be moved around on the map as the group discusses layout  a Basic Elements of a Community Garden  Although there are exceptions to every rule co mmunity gardens should almost always include   At least 15 plots assigned to community members  These should be placed in the sunniest part of the garden  Without plots f or individual participation it is very difficult to achieve longte rm community involvement  Raised bed plots which are more expensive should be no more than 4 feet wide to facilitate access to plants from the sides w ithout stepping into the bed an d between 8 and 12 feet long it is advisable to construct your ra ised beds in sizes that are found in readilyavailable lumber or that can be cut without too much waste  Inground plots can be from 10 x 10 up to 20 x 20 feet  Pathways between beds and plots should be least 3 to 4 feet wide to allow space for wheelbarrows  The soil in both raised bed and inground plots should be amended with aged compost or manure to improve its fertility and increase its organic matter content   A simple irrigation system with one hose bib or faucet for every four plots  Hand watering with a hose is the most practical  and affordable for individual plots and its al most a necessity when you start plants from  seed  Drip and soakerhose irrigation  can be used in all areas of the garden for transplanted and establishe d plants but especially for deep rooted fruit trees and ornamen tals  If no one in your group is knowledgeable about irrigation you might need some assistance in designing your irrigation system  Se ek out a landscape contractor or nursery or garden center professional to help you develop a basic layout and materials list   An 8foot fence around the perimeter with a drivethrough gate   In our experience this is a key element of success  Dont count on eliminating all acts of vandalism or theft but fencing will help to keep these to tolerably low levels   A tool shed or other structure for storing tools supplies and materials  Recycled metal shipping containers make excellent  storage sheds and are almost vandalproof  Contact the Port Authority for leads on where to find them   A bench or picnic table where gardeners can sit relax and take  a breakpreferably in shade  If there are no shade trees o n the site a simple arbor can be constructed from wood or pipe and planted with chayote squash bougainvillea grapes kiwis or so me other vine   A sign with the gardens name sponsors and a contact persons phone number for more information  If your community is bilingual include information in this language   A shared composting area for the community  gardeners  Wood pallets are easy to comeby and when stood onend attached in a Ushape and the inside covered with galvanized rabbitwire make excellent compost bins  b Nice Additions to Your Garden Plan   A small fruit tree orchard whose care and harvest can be shared  by all the members  The or chard can also create shade for people as well as shadeloving plants   A water fountain  This can be a simple drinking fountain attachment to a hose bib or faucet you can purchase at a hardware  store   Perimeter landscaping which can focus on drought tolerant  flowers and shrubs plants which attract butterflies and hummingbirds or roses and other flowers suitable for cutting bou quets  Herbs are also wellsuited to perimeter landscaping an d help to create barriers to unwanted pest insects who do not like the smell of their essential oils   A childrens area which can include special small pl ots for children a sand box and play equipment   A meeting area which could range from a semicircle of hay ba les or tree stumps to a simple amphitheater built of recycled  broken concrete  Building a shade struct ure above would be beneficial as well  10 Creating a Garden Budget  Use your design to develop a materials list and costout the pr oject  You will need to callaround to get prices on fencing an d other items  You might be surprised at the cost  A community garden with just the Basic Elements listed above typically costs bet ween 2500 to 5000  At this point your group might decide to scale back your initial plans and save some design ideas for a Ph ase Two of the garden  11 Where to Get Materials and Money  While some startup funds will be needed through determination and hard work you can obtain donations of materials for your project  Community businesses might assist and provide anything from fencing to lumber to plants  The important thing is to ask  Develop a letter that tells merchants about your project and why its important to the community  Attach your wish list but  be reasonable  Try to personalize this letter for each business you approach  Drop it off personally with the store manager pre ferably with a couple of cute kids who will be gard ening in tow  Then followup by phone  Be patient persistent and polite  Your efforts will payoff with at least some of the businesses you approach  Be sure to thank these key supporters and recognize them on yo ur garden sign at a garden grand opening or other special event  Money which will be needed to purchase items not donated can be  obtained through community fundraisers such as car washes craft and rummage sales pancake breakfasts and bake sales  They can also be  obtained by writing grants but be aware grant writing efforts can take six months or longer to yield results an d you must have a fiscal sponsor or agent with taxexempt 501 c3 status such as a church or nonprofit corporation that agrees to administer the funds  12 Make Sure Your Garden Infrastructure is in Place  If you have not yet formed a garden club now is the time to do so  Its also time to establish garden rules develop a garden  application form for those who wish to participate set up a bank account and determine what garden dues will be if these thin gs have not already been done  This is also the time to begin having monthly meetings if you have not already done so  Also if you havent already contacted your city councilperson he or she can be helpful in many ways including helping your group obtain ci ty services such as trash pickup  Their staff can also help you with community organizing and soliciting for material donations   13   Get Growing  Many new garden groups make the mistake of remaining in the planning design and fundraising stage for an extended period of time  There is a fine line between planning well and over plan ning  After several months of the initial research designing planning and outreach efforts group members will very like ly be feeling frustrated and will begin to wonder if all their effo rts will ever result in a garden  Thats why its important to plant something on your site as soon as possible  People need to see vi sible results or they will begin to lose interest in the project  To keep the momentum going initiate the following steps even if y ou are still seeking donations and funds or your project but not until you have signed a lease and obtained insurance  a Clean up the Site Schedule community workdays to clean up the site  How many work days you need will depend on the size of the site and how much and what kind of debris are on site    b Install the Irrigation System Without water you cant grow anything  So get this key element into place as soon as possible  There are plenty of opportuni ties for community involvementfrom digging trenches to laying out PVC pipes  c Plant Something Once you have water there are many options for ingarden action  Stake out beds and pathways by marking them with stakes and twine  Mulch pathways  If your fence is nt in yet some people might still want to accept the risk of vandalism and get their  plots started  You can also plant shade and fruit trees and begin to landscape the site  If you do not yet have a source of donated  plants or dont wish to risk having them vandalized plant annual flower  seeds which will grow quickly and can be replaced later  See ds for Los Angeles County community and school gardens can be obtained through the Common Ground Garden Program 323 2603348  d Continue to construct the garden as  materials and funds become available  14 Celebrate  At this point your ideas and hard work have finally become a community garden  Be sure to take time to celebrate  Have a gra nd opening barbecue or some other fun event to give everyone who helped to make this happen a special thankyou  This is the t ime to give all those who gave donated materials or time a sp ecial certificate bouquet or other form of recognition  15 Troubleshooting as the Garden Develops   5All community gardens will experience problems somewhere along  the way  Dont get discourageget organized  The key to success for community gardens is not only preventing problems from ever occurring but also working together to solve them when they do inevitably occur  In our experience these are some of the most common problems that cropup in community gardens and our suggestions for solving them  a Vandalism Most gardens experience occasional vandalism  The best action you can take is to replant immediately  Generally the vandals become bored after a while and st op  Good community outr each especially to youth and the ga rdens immediately neighbors is al so important  Most importantdont get to discouraged  It happens  Get over it and keep going  What about barbed wired or raz or wire to make the garden more secure  Our advicedont  Its  bad for community relations looks awful and is sometimes illeg al to install without a permit  If you need more physical deterrents to keep vandals out plant bougainvillea or pyracantha along yo ur fence their thorns will do the trick  b Security Invite the community officer from your local precinct to a garden meeting to get their suggestions on making the garden more secure  Community officers can also be a great help in solving problems with garden vandalism and dealing with drug dealers and gang members in the area  c Communication Clear and wellenforced garden rules and a strong garden president can go a long way towards minimizing misunderstandings in th e garden  But communication problems do arise  Its the job of the garden club to resolve those issues  If its something not clearly spelled out in the rules the membership can take a vote to add new rules and make modifications to existing rules  Language barriers are a very common source of misunderstandings  Garden club leadership should make every effort to have a translator at garden meetings where partic ipants are bilingualperhaps a family member  of one of the garden members who speaks  the language will offer to help  d Trash Its important to get your compost system going right away and get some training for gardeners on how to use it  If gardeners dont compost large quantities of waste will begin to build up create an eyesore and could hurt your  relationships with neighbors and the property owner  Waste can also become a fire hazard  Make su re gardeners know how to sort trash properly what to compost an d what to recycle  Trash cans placed in accessible areas are helpful to keep  a neat and tidy garden  e Gardener DropOut There has been and probably always will be a high rate of turn over in community gardens  Often people sign up for plots and  then dont follow through  Remember gardening is hard work for so me people especially in the heat  of summer  Be sure to hav e a clause in your gardener agreement which stat es gardeners forfeit their right to their plot if they dont plant it within one mo nth or if they dont maintain it  While gardeners should be given ever y opportunity to follow through if after several reminders either  by letter or phone nothing changes it is time for the club to reassi gn the plot  It is also advi sable that every year the leade rship conduct a renewed community outreach campaig n by contacting churches and other groups in the neighborhood to let them know about the garden and that  plots are available  f Weeds Gardeners tend to visit their plots less during the winter time and lower participation combined with rain tends to create a  huge weed problem in January February and March   Remember part of your agreement with  the landowner is that you will maintain the lot and keep weeds from taking over  In the late summerear ly fall provide gardeners with a workshop or printed material about what can be grown in a fall and winter garden  Also schedule garden workdays for the spring in advance since you know youll need them at the end of winter to clear weeds  If you anticip ate that plots will be untended during the winter apply a thick layer of mulch or hay to the beds and paths to reduce weed proliferation  Good luck with your community garden project
