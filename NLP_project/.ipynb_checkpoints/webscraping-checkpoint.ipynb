      "Title: The California Homegrown Food Act\n",
      "Content: About the California Homegrown Food ActThe Sustainable Economies Law Center will soon seek a California legislator to author a bill in 2013 to reduce legal barriers to the cultivation and sale of homegrown and locally-grown produce. We have posted a summary of the bill here in order to seek feedback.  Please post a comment letting us know your thoughts on the proposal below, or email Janelle.SELC [at] gmail.com with your questions and comments. Thank you!Purposes and SummaryThe purposes of the California Homegrown Food Act are to:1) Increase access to fresh, locally sourced produce for all Californians regardless of location and other socioeconomic limitations;2) Allow individuals to supplement their incomes through sale of produce grown at home or on other urban or suburban land; and3) Reduce the carbon footprint of our food system by enabling the increased cultivation of produce in or near places it is consumed.The Act will achieve these purposes by ensuring the rights of individuals and groups to cultivate and, in certain cases, sell edible plants. The Act will remove a handful of barriers arising from local zoning laws, private land covenants, and lease restrictions.  Producers must, however, still comply with any and all relevant health, agricultural, and environmental regulations.  The Act will specify the types of allowable food production practices and basis for regulation by defining three types of food growing activities and specifying reasonable limits and regulations thereof.Findings and DeclarationsThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:a) California industrial agriculture is at risk due to water shortages, soil degradation, pollution, environmental and structural threats to the San Francisco Bay Delta, and the rising cost of oil.  A food shortage from these problems is a real and imminent threat. Providing Californians with the capacity to feed themselves and their communities would drastically improve local food security and mediate the risks of  water, soil, environmental, or fuel-related crises.b) Though California is the “bread basket” of the United States and has regions of climate and land ideal for agriculture, a significant amount of California’s food is grown hundreds or thousands of miles from where it is consumed. This results in high transportation costs, energy consumption, and lost economic opportunity for our state. Even food grown in the heart of California’s farming region is expensive to disperse to the rest of the state due to rising fuel costs.c) California is no exception to rising U.S. obesity and obesity-related diseases.  It is important to note that:1. Two-thirds of American adults and nearly one-third of American children are obese or overweight, putting them at risk for developing chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, or cancer.2. One in every nine California children, one in three teens, and over half of adults are already overweight or obese. This epidemic affects virtually all Californians.3. These health conditions are preventable and curable through lifestyle choices that include consumption of healthy fresh foods.d) One of every ten dollars spent on health care in the United States goes toward treating diabetes and its complications. Facilitating opportunities for California residents to grow and consume fresh, healthy foods will promote lifestyles and diets that benefit individuals and communities, as well as more effective use of public dollars.e) Many homeowners associations have rules prohibiting homeowners from growing food in front yards or from selling food grown on the property.f) Additionally, approximately 40% of Californians are renters and may, as a result of lease restrictions or disapproval by the landlord, face limitations on their ability to grow food on the land where they reside.g) Providing Californians with increased opportunity to participate in small-scale entrepreneurial agriculture will supplement incomes during times of high unemployment and under-employment and stimulate local economies.DefinitionsAs used in this Act, the following types of uses shall be defined as follows:Personal Agriculture:A use specific to residential zones in which individuals cultivate produce at their own residence for personal consumption or donation.Community Garden:A use in which land managed by a public entity, nonprofit organization, individual, or group of individuals is used to cultivate produce for donation or for personal consumption by those cultivating the land.EntrepreneurialAgriculture:A use in which land managed by a public entity, nonprofit organization, business entity, individual, or group of individuals is used to cultivate produce for the purpose of sale.Produce:Raw, unprocessed fruits, vegetables, herbs, and nuts.Portion of the Bill Addressing Local Zoning LawsThe California Government Code shall be amended to require that city and county governments allow the following agricultural uses, subject to the following regulations and restrictions:Personal Agriculturea. Where Personal Agricultureshall bepermitted:Personal Agriculture shall be considered an accessory use in residential zones.b. Allowable Regulations of Personal Agriculture:Zoning regulations may not prohibit the cultivation of food plants in front or back yards for personal use.  However, cities may make reasonable restrictions pertaining to height of plant material and the  presence of dead plant material in  front yards.  Note that cities may not restrict the use of dead plant material that is to be used as ground cover, mulch, or compost.  Cities may adopt regulations to restrict plants that could interfere with a public sidewalk.Community Gardens:a. Where Community Gardensshall bepermitted:1.  In residential zones:Community Gardens shall be a permitted use.2. In commercial zones:Community Gardens shall be a permitted use.3. In industrial zones:Community Gardens shall be a permitted use.b. Allowable Regulation of Community Gardens:Any structures for community gardening may be subject to the development standards of the zone as they apply to accessory structuresEntrepreneurialAgriculture:a. Where Entrepreneurial Agricultureshall bepermitted:1. In residential zones:Entrepreneurial Agriculture shall be a permitted use in residential zones and shall be considered an accessory use to a residence.  However, any food plant cultivation for Entrepreneurial Agriculture purposes that occupies more than 5,000 square feet of land may be required by a city or county to obtain a conditional use permit. Entrepreneurial Agriculture in residential areas may be subject to the following additional restrictions:A. Only mechanical equipment designed for household use may be used.B. Retail sales and all other public use of the farm shall begin no earlier than 7 a.m. and end by 7 p.m. every day of the week.C. Commercial deliveries and pickups are limited to one per day. On-site sales are not considered commercial pickups.D.  One identification sign is permitted, not exceeding 64 square inches in area.2. In commercial zones:Entrepreneurial Agriculture shall be a permitted use.3. In industrial zones:Entrepreneurial Agriculture shall be a permitted use.b. Regulations on Entrepreneurial Agriculture:In all zones, odor, noise, and dust caused by Entrepreneurial Agriculture may be limited to “what a reasonable individual can tolerate” at a distance of more than 100 feet from site of the Entrepreneurial Agriculture activity.Portion of the Bill Addressing Homeowners AssociationsSection 1353.10 is added to the California Civil Code, to read:a. Notwithstanding any other law, a provision of any of the governing documents of a common interest development shall be void and unenforceable if it does any of the following:1. Prohibits, or includes conditions that have the effect of prohibiting, the use of a Homeowner’s front or back yard, for Personal Agriculture or Entrepreneurial Agriculture.2. Prohibits, or includes conditions that have the effect of prohibiting, a Homeowner from theoff-sitesale or donation of produce grown on the Homeowner’s property.b. This section applies only to yards that are designated for the exclusive use of the Homeowner.c. This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations restrictingon-sitesale of agricultural products.e. This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations restricting the hours of operation and the number of visitors to gardens within the association.f. This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations requiring that dead plant material and weeds, with the exception of straw, mulch, and other organic materials intended to encourage vegetation and retention of moisture in the soil, are regularly cleared from the front yard.g. This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations requiring that gardens and crops do not grow more than six feet in height to preserve aesthetic appeal and cleanliness.Portion of the Bill Addressing Tenant Food CultivationApproximately40% of Californians live in residences that they do not own, which means that such tenants may have restricted rights to cultivate food, depending on what is permitted by the landlord and the lease agreement.  This Act would give tenants some rights to cultivate food, so long as such cultivation does not unreasonably interfere with existing landscaping or with common area uses by other tenants.Definitions:“Common area” refers to an area of the property that is shared with other tenants.“Private area” refers to an area of the property that is for the exclusive use of a tenant.The Act would protect the ability of tenants to cultivate and sell food, as follows:a.  A landlord shall allow a tenant to participate in Personal Agriculture or Entrepreneurial Agriculture under the following circumstances:1.Container Plants:A tenant may cultivate food plants in containers, so long as:A. The tenant regularly removes any dead plant material and weeds.B. The placement of the containers does not interfere with any existing plants.C. The placement of the containers does not interfere with any tenant’s parking spot.D. The placement of the containers does not create a trip-and-fall hazard.E. The placement of the containers does not cause water damage to any portion of the property.F. If the containers are to be placed on top of grass, the landlord may require the tenant to re-plant grass prior to vacating the property.2.Plants in the Ground or Raised Beds:A tenant may cultivate food plants in the ground or in a raised bed, so long as:A. The tenant agrees to restore or pay for the restoration of any landscaping roughly to its original condition when the tenant vacates the property or ceases to engage in food cultivation.B. The  tenant regularly removes any dead plant material and weeds for the food cultivation area.C. The tenant must not leave any hazards in the common area, including holes or gardening tools.3.Impact on Neighbors and Other Tenants:A tenant may not engage in gardening activities in any common areas before 7:00am or after 9:00pm; gardening activities must not interfere with the quiet enjoyment of other residents and neighbors. If the landlord determines, due to complaints from other residents, that the garden area is interfering with the rights of other tenants or neighbors with respect to their quiet enjoyment of the property, the landlord may terminate the tenant’s gardening rights, with 30 days written notice. The notice must explain the basis for termination of gardening rights. Such notice does not constitute a notice of termination of tenancy.4.Gardening in Common Areas:If the gardening is done in common areas, other residents must be notified in writing 15 days prior to the commencement of any food cultivation activity and given an opportunity to bring their concerns to the landlord’s attention. If more than 25% of the tenants object to the gardening activity in the common area and if their concerns are not addressed through a change in the gardening plan, then the landlord may prohibit the food cultivation activity in the common area.5.Restoration of Landscaping:With the exception of container plants on paved areas, the landlord may choose to require an additional security deposit to ensure that all landscaping may be restored after the tenant vacates the property or ceases to engage in food cultivation.6.Payment of Water and Waste Collection Bills:A landlord may require the tenant to enter into a written agreement regarding the payment of any excess water and waste collection bills stemming from the garden.7.Inspection Rights:The landlord has a right to periodically inspect the garden area to ensure compliance with the above rules.8.Off-Site Sales:The landlord may not prevent tenants from selling products derived from this gardening at an off-site location.b. Furthermore, a landlord may prohibit a tenant from engaging in Entrepreneurial Agriculture, unless the tenant demonstrates that the Entrepreneurial Agriculture operations maintain in force either liability insurance covering injury to clients and guests in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) per occurrence and three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) in the total annual aggregate, sustained on account of the negligence of the licensee or its employees, or a bond in the aggregate amount of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000).ShareEmailPrintFacebookLinkedInTumblrTwitterPinterestRedditDiggPocketGoogleStumbleUpon\n"

      "Gardening is becoming more popular in every corner of the country. Rather than taking care of houseplants, people are focusing on growing food.\n",
      "Urban gardening in Los Angeles is a great way to grow fresh produce for yourself or tosell at farmers markets. Whether you hope to grow a personal garden for fresh produce, join a community garden, or create an urban garden with other residents, Los Angeles is the place. It has a long growing season that’s perfect for producing a variety of vegetables and herbs.\n",
      "Read this comprehensive guide to get started!\n",
      "Can you make a profit from your urban garden?\n",
      "Yes! Some urban gardeners sell fresh vegetables and herbs to local businesses or at farmers markets.\n",
      "People plant urban gardens for a variety of reasons. For example, your garden could provide food for you and your family. Alternatively, maybe you’ll share the produce with the local community for a profit. Either way, your goal will be an important factor in planning the size, location, and types of plants for your urban garden. As a result, understanding your options will help you determine the future of your urban garden.\n",
      "A personal urban garden is one that’s meant to provide fresh food for you and your family. You might save money on your weekly grocery run, but you aren’t generating a profit from personal urban gardening. There are a variety of ways to grow food for your family in Los Angeles, even for city dwellers with only a small amount of space. Those options include:\n",
      "People are earning $1,000s per year from their garages and outdoor space.\n",
      "You're in control. Approve who rents and the hours of access.\n",
      "Sit back and collect automatic payments each month.\n",
      "Depending on the amount of space you have available, any containers deep enough to let plants grow roots — around 10 -12 inches — can be used for plants. You’ll simply need to put holes in the bottom to allow the soil to drain properly.\n",
      "If you have yard space to grow vegetables, thena raised bed gardencan help you avoid weeds. Raised beds can also be used on concrete patios or sidewalks. Raised beds can be built on sloping land, as well.\n",
      "Some community gardens are designed for growing commercial vegetables only. However, others allow residents to rent spaces within them for personal use. There are over 100 community gardens in Los Angeles (and we’ll discuss them later in this article).\n",
      "A vertical urban garden is a type of container garden that uses vertical space to compensate for small areas. Tiered containers, hanging pots, and trellises, for example, may be used to help plants use vertical space.\n",
      "If you have very little space, then planter boxes are an option for growing small plants. Typically used for herbs or flowers, these boxes are placed directly outside a window for easy plant watering and care.\n",
      "A commercial urban garden is designed for growing produce you want to sell. Starting a vegetable garden can help you make money from home. Small urban gardens also need only a relatively small start-up investment.\n",
      "If you don’t have the space for a garden at home, then there are other urban farming solutions you can try. Many people participate in a community garden, for example, to provide local vegetables to the area andgenerate an extra income stream. These are a few ways you can get started growing an urban garden in Los Angeles to generate a profit:\n",
      "Even if you don’t use your entire yard, you can make a profit from vegetables you grow in your yard space. Maximize your yield with vertical gardening techniques, raised beds, and companion planting. If you’re short on space, then you can even grow herbs on a windowsill.\n",
      "Some community gardens are nonprofit organizations. Therefore, they depend on volunteers to grow food for donations. Others provide rental plots that allow you to grow vegetables and herbs for your consumption or for a profit.\n",
      "Whether you’re growing vegetables for your family’s health or in hopes of creating a revenue stream, start small. This can help you avoid getting overwhelmed.\n",
      "The climate in Los Angeles, California, provides one of the longest growing seasons in the country. When you’re choosing plants for an urban garden, you’ll also need to consider which months you’ll be planting and how much time you want to spend gardening.\n",
      "If you’re growing a garden for personal use, then starting small with the vegetables you like most can provide added incentive to succeed. Also, vegetables for commercial gardens should have a shorter growing period for maximum profit. Thisguidewill help you decide when to plant seedlings in your urban garden.\n",
      "Los Angeles planting zones range from 7 to 11, which means many plants can be planted in early spring. Some options and their planting months are:\n",
      "Many types of vegetables can be grown during California’s summer season if you have a good watering system and avoid too much full sun exposure. Extend the spring growth season with:\n",
      "As summer turns to fall, cooler air promotes better growth. Try urban gardening with these plants because they can keep producing through late fall:\n",
      "Winter vegetables can be planted in late September and into October. Some good vegetable options are:\n",
      "In the absence of frost, vegetables can even be grown or harvested during November and December. So you can also try planting these veggies in the late fall:\n",
      "If you intend to plant more vegetables immediately after harvesting, then choose plants from a different crop family. Rotating crop families can help you avoid garden diseases or poor soil quality.\n",
      "Fresh herbs can complement any meal. They can also provide pest control when grown alongside organic vegetables. These herbs grow well in California’s dry climate:\n",
      "\n",
      "The vegetables you choose to plant will inevitably be determined by more than their seasons and planting schedules. After all, you probably want to grow the vegetables you love so you can enjoy them. However, if you plan to sell vegetables, it’s important to consider planting cycles and the plants that will sell best in your area. Choosing the right plants and creative planting techniques will help you make the most of limited space.\n",
      "If you hope to make a significant profit from your urban garden, choosing your plants carefully is a good way to start.\n",
      "Vegetables with a short growing season and a high yield per plant will provide the biggest crop. In addition, you can enjoy the produce multiple times throughout the season. Bountiful plants are also motivating if you’re just starting to grow a green thumb. Try some of these vegetables to get the most out of your limited space:\n",
      "These small root vegetables mature in 21-28 days. Also, it may be a big seller at local restaurants.\n",
      "Greens like lettuce, spinach, endive, and Swiss chard mature in 45 to 50 days. Succession planting can yield multiple harvests.\n",
      "Arugula matures in 45-60 days, and it should be harvested before it flowers.\n",
      "Cherry and grape tomatoes, for example, produce large amounts of fruit that are ready in 65-70 days. Some medium-sized tomatoes ripen quickly, as well. These include Early Girl (around 50 days), Early Wonder, Bloody Butcher, Red Alert, and Alaskan Fancy (55 days).\n",
      "Pickling cucumbers have the fastest growth cycle, and they can be used for both pickling and salads. Cucumbers mature in 50-75 days.\n",
      "Green and wax beans, for example, grow rapidly in warm weather, maturing in 55-65 days.\n",
      "Summer squash matures in 40-55 days, and it can be planted with trellises for vertical growth to save space. Zucchini takes a little longer (around 60 days) and typically produces a large crop.\n",
      "Okra reaches maturity in 50-65 days, and the plants can produce for 10-12 weeks.\n",
      "While they can take 70-90 days to mature, pepper plants love full sunlight and heat. They’re an excellent choice in California.\n",
      "Fresh herbs are popular for seasoning restaurant meals, as well as the meals you make at home. Popular varieties include basil, chives, oregano, parsley, lavender, and chamomile.\n",
      "Growing what you and your family love to eat makes the most sense if you hope to enjoy your garden. Still, when you have limited space (maybe you’re evenrenting a storage unit), it can be difficult to figure out how to make everything fit. Try some of these tips to keep your favorite veggies and herbs from hogging all the space in your urban garden.\n",
      "Get creative with containers. Practically anything that will hold soil can be used to grow plants. Different types of containers can help you save space. Self-watering pots can also help your plants grow if you want to start container gardening but you’re worried about parched soil.\n",
      "Planning is the key to success when creating a garden in a small space. You should know how much space you need, the supplies you’ll require to get started, and what you hope to accomplish with your urban garden. Use these steps to get started when you’ve decided to plant an urban garden:\n",
      "Why did you decide to grow a garden? If you hope to provide food for your family, then personal tastes will be an important factor in the plants you choose. For gardens designed to teach children, it’s vital to create a space where they can participate. If you hope to make a profit, then you’ll need to learn about which plants have the best return on investment.\n",
      "The location of your urban garden will dictate how much space you have and the amount of sunlight your plants will get each day. Although Los Angeles is sunny many days of the year, trees and surrounding buildings can shade your urban garden.\n",
      "Your location is one of the most vital factors in planning your garden. Are you interested in joining a community garden? If so, learn about the gardens in your neighborhood and which ones have space available to find the right fit.\n",
      "Do you have space in your backyard where you can plant directly in the ground? Even if you have space on the ground, raised beds have advantages you might want to consider. If you plan to use a deck, patio, or even a fire escape, then you will need to consider the types of containers you’ll use.\n",
      "You will need containers, potting soil, fertilizer, and plants to grow vegetables or herbs. You might also invest in some tools like a hand trowel to help you garden with ease.\n",
      "Should you use seeds or plants in your urban garden?\n",
      "If you’re new to gardening, then seedlings (small plants) are the easiest to grow.\n",
      "Seeds come in packets, some of which can create hundreds of plants. However, unlike plants, seeds often need to be started indoors and can take anywhere from days to weeks to germinate. Seedlings are plants that are in season and ready to plant outdoors. Seedlings are often easier to care for and provide you with a clear picture of your future garden.\n",
      "A garden is most enjoyable when the time and harvest is shared with those you love. Gather family members or friends and neighbors to help you create a garden. Vegetable and herb gardens can supply a variety of plants to entice everyone with a green thumb to join in the fun.\n",
      "Check local ordinances, zoning laws, and building restrictions before planting your urban garden. Some ordinances may restrict the types of plants you can plant and where you put them.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don’t have the backyard or patio space for an urban garden, you can still find opportunities to grow your own plants in Los Angeles. Community gardens are shared plots of land where locals gather to plant vegetables, herbs, plants, and flowers. Community gardens are often managed by volunteers, and you’ll likely have to pay a small rental fee for your own gardening space.\n",
      "There are more than 125 community gardens in Los Angeles. The list includes traditional community gardens, educational gardens, and urban farms. To learn about community gardens in your neighborhood, visit theLos Angeles Community Garden Council.\n",
      "Many community gardens also host classes and workshops, have websites, and plan events that are open to the public. Get to know the community gardens in your area by visiting a few before deciding where you want to join. These are a few of the community gardens located in Los Angeles:\n",
      "Spring Street Community Garden has over 35 raised beds, compost bins, and picnic tables. The organization advocates for low income and homeless residents of Los Angeles. It’s located on S. Spring Street.\n",
      "Founded nearly 40 years ago, Ocean View Farms provides practically countless plots to choose from. It’s located on S. Centinela Avenue.\n",
      "With approximately 5,000 square feet of growing space, Erica J. Glazer Garden has 35 plots. Located on Richmond Avenue, the garden is a great resource for USC students.\n",
      "Santa Monica Community Garden plots are only available to Santa Monica Residents. It’s actually a trio of gardens, and the three locations provide 117 plots. Applications are available on a first-come, first-served basis. The locations are on Main Street, Park Drive, and Euclid Park.\n",
      "Rosewood is located in a residential area. It provides an opportunity for many local children to learn about how food is grown, what is used, and the work that’s involved. It’s located on Rosewood Avenue.\n",
      "The four gardens of Wattles Mansion became a community garden in 1975 and officially turned into a nonprofit space in 1978. The garden’s 172 plots have over 300 members. It’s located on North Curson Avenue.\n",
      "Located on a one-acre portion of Orville Wright Middle School, the garden is run entirely by volunteers. The nonprofit organic garden is shared by the school and the public for community building and educational purposes.\n",
      "Fountain Community Garden has 65 plots and over 100 urban gardeners. It is a place where residents can grow food for their families. You can find it on East Hollywood, near 101 Freeway and Fountain Avenue.\n",
      "If you rent a plot in a community garden, then take the time to meet your neighbors. You can learn new gardening tips and meet new people within the community.\n",
      "Creating a new community garden is always a welcome idea in Los Angeles. If you hope to transform an empty lot or create access to a gardening space, then it’s important to get started the right way. You will need to know local ordinances, how you plan to manage the garden’s finances, and other early planning facts to bring your garden to life.\n",
      "Answering these questions can help you prepare:\n",
      "Also, do you know what the land was used for in the past? Make sure you conduct a soil test before you start planting.\n",
      "Educational urban gardens, traditional community gardens, and urban farms each have different needs and requirements.\n",
      "See if there other residents in the area willing to volunteer time or interested in becoming urban gardeners themselves. You could also form a volunteer leadership group.\n",
      "You may be able to get assistance from the Los Angeles Community Garden Council. Also, consider if there are funds available for start-up costs, garden maintenance, and water bills.\n",
      "Additional tools include a sample of garden rules, a plot application and garden budget template, and a tool list. You may also wish to find a local mentor who can help you learn all the details related to managing a community garden.\n",
      "Growing an urban garden is a fun project, and it provides local food for communities. Urban gardening is also a great way for families and communities to interact. Urban gardens can be an introduction to a healthier lifestyle and even generate a profit. No matter why you love gardening, Los Angeles provides a variety of ways to get started and enjoy the city.\n"
