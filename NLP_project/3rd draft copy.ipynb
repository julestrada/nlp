       "' \\nCOMMUNITY GARDEN START-UP GUIDE \\n \\nBy \\nRachel Surls, UCCE County Director \\nWith Help of Chris Braswell and Laura Harris, Los Angeles Conservation Corps \\nUpdated March 2001 by \\nYvonne Savio, Common Ground Garden Program Manager, UCCE \\n This \"Community Garden Start-Up Guide\" is intended to help neighborhood groups and organizations along the path to starting \\nand sustaining a community garden. \\nWhy Start a Community Garden?  \\n Many families living in the city would like to grow some of their own fruits, vegetables, herbs, and flowers.  Some want to sa ve \\nmoney on their food bills.  Others like the freshness, flavor an d wholesomeness of home-grown produce.  And for many, gardening  is \\na relaxing way to exercise and enjoy being out-of-doors.  There are also families from other cultures who would like to grow \\ntraditional foods not available in the supermarket.  \\n Community gardens beautify neighborhoods and help bring neighbors closer together.  They have been proven as tools to reduce neighborhood crime--particularly when vacant, blighted lots are targeted for garden development.  Community gardens provide saf e, \\nrecreational green space in urban areas with little or no park land, and can contribute greatly  to keeping urban air clean. \\n \\n Those who are lucky enough to have sunny backyards or balconies can plant a garden whenever they  have the time and energy.  \\nBut what about those who do not have a place to garden?  For these people, community gardens may be the answer. \\n \\nStep by Step To Your Own Community Garden  \\n1. Get Your Neighbors Involved  \\nThere is a lot of work involved in starting a new garden.  Make  sure you have several people who will help you.  Over the years , our \\nexperience indicates that there should be at least ten interested families to cr eate and sustain a garden project.  Survey the residents of \\nyour neighborhood to see if they are interested and would participate.  Hold monthly meetings of the interested group to develo p and \\ninitiate plans, keep people posted on the garden\\'s progress, and keep them involved in the process from day one.  \\n2. Form a Garden Club  \\nA garden club is a way of formally organizing your new group.  It helps you make decisions and divide-up the work effectively.  It \\nalso ensures that every one has a vested interest in the garden and can contribute to its design, development, and maintenance.   It can \\nbe formed at any time during the process of  starting a community garden; however, it\\'s wi se to do so early on.  This way, club \\nmembers can share in the many tasks of establishing the new gard en.  The typical garden club will have many functions, includin g: \\n• Establishing garden rules (see sample) \\n• Accepting and reviewing garden applications \\n• Making plot assignments \\n• Collecting garden dues (if any) \\n• Paying water bills \\n• Resolving conflicts \\nThe typical garden club has at least two officers:  a president and a treasurer; although your garden club may have more if nec essary.  \\nElections for garden officers usually are held annually.   \\n \\n 2\\nFind Land for the Garden \\n \\nLook around your neighbor hood for a vacant lo t that gets plenty of sun--at least six to  eight hours each day.  A garden site sh ould be \\nrelatively flat (although slight slopes ca n be terraced).  It should be relatively fr ee of large pieces of concrete left behind  from \\ndemolition of structures.  Any rubble or debris should be manageable--that is, it can be removed by volunteers clearing the lot  with \\ntrash bags, wheelbarrows, and pick up trucks.  Ideally, it should have a fence around it with a gate wide enough for a vehicle to \\nenter.  It is possible to work with a site that is paved with  concrete or asphalt by building raised beds that sit on the surfa ce or using \\ncontainers.  You can also remove the asphalt or concrete to cr eate areas for gardens, but such a garden will be much more diffi cult, \\nexpensive, and time-consuming to start.  A site without pa ving, and soil relatively free of trash and debris is best. \\n \\nThe potential garden site should be within walking, or no more  than a short drive from you and the neighbors who have expressed  \\ninterest in participating.  If the lot is not already being used , make sure the community supports establishing a garden there.  \\n \\nIt\\'s best to select three potential sites in your neighborhood and write down their address and ne arest cross streets.  If you don\\'t know \\nthe address of a vacant lot, get the addresses of the properti es on both sides of the lot--this will give you the ability to ma ke an \\neducated guess on the address of the site.  We suggest you identify at least three potential sites b ecause one or more might no t be \\navailable for you to use for various reasons, and you want to end up with at least one that works out. \\n \\n3. Find out Who Owns the Land \\n \\nIt is illegal to use land without obtaining the owners permission.  In order to obtain permission, you must first find out who owns the \\nland. \\n \\nTake the information you have written down about the location of th e sites in step 3 to your county\\'s tax assessor\\'s office.  T he Los \\nAngeles County Tax Assessor\\'s office is located at 225 North Hill Street, Room 205.  Or go to a branch office listed in the whi te \\npages of the telephone directory.  At this office, you will look  through the map books to get the names and addresses of the ow ner of \\nthe sites you are interested in. \\n \\n4. Find out if Your Proposed Site has Water \\n \\nWhile you are researching site ownership, contact the water servi ce provider in your area to fi nd out if your potential site(s)  \\nhas/have an existing water meter to hook-in to.  Call your water provider\\'s customer service department, and ask them to conduc t a \\n\"site investigation\".  They will need the same location inform ation that you took with you to the Tax Asse ssor\\'s office. \\n \\nExisting access to water will make a critical difference in the expense of getting your project started.  Depending on the size  of your \\ngarden site, you will need a 1/2-inch to 1-inch water meter.  If there has been water service to the site in the past, it is re latively \\ninexpensive to get a new water meter installed (if one doesn\\'t al ready exist).  If there has never been water service to that s ite, it \\nmight cost much more for your water provider to install a lateral line from the street main to the site and install your new me ter. \\n \\n5 Contact the Land Owner \\n \\nOnce you have determined that your potential site is feasible, write a letter to the landowner asking for permission to use the  \\nproperty for a community garden.  Be sure to mention to the landowner the value of the garden to the community and the fact the  \\ngardeners will be responsible for keeping the site clean and weed -free (this saves landowners from maintaining the site or payi ng \\ncity weed abatement fees).  \\nEstablish a term for use of the site, and prepare and negotiate a lease.  Typically, groups lease garden sites from land owners  for $1 \\nper year.  You should attempt to negotiate a lease for a least thr ee years (or longer if the proper ty owner is agreeable).  Man y \\nlandowners are worried about their liability for injuries that mi ght occur at the garden.  Therefore, you should include a simp le \"hold \\nharmless\" waiver in the lease and in gardener agreement forms.  For more information on the lease, and the hold harmless waiver , \\nsee 8, \"Signing a Lease\".  \\nBe prepared to purchase liability insuran ce to protect further the property owner (and  yourself) should an accident occur at th e \\ngarden.  For more information on the hold harmless waiver, and liability insurance, see 8, \"Signing a Lease\", and 9, \"Obtaining  \\nLiability Insurance\". \\n \\n6. Get Your Soil Tested \\n \\nIt might be advisable to have the soil at the site tested for fertility pH and presence of hea vy metals.  Contact a private lab . \\n \\n7. Signing a Lease \\n \\nLandowners of potential garden sites might be concerned abou t their liability should someone be injured while working in the \\ngarden.  Your group should be prepared to offer the landowner a lease with a \"hold harmless\" waiver.  This \"hold harmless\" waiv er \\ncan simply state that should one of the ga rdeners be injured as a result of negligence  on the part of another gardener, the lan downer \\nis \"held harmless\" and will not be sued.  Each gardener should be made aware of this waiver and sh ould be required to sign an \\n 3\\nagreement in order to obtain a plot in the community garden.  A sample gardener agreement form is attached which your \\ngroup can use as a model.  \\n8. Obtaining Liability Insurance \\n \\nLandowners may also require that your group purchase liabilit y insurance.  Community gardeners in the Los Angeles area can \\nobtain inexpensive policies from Metro Farm Gardens.  Contact Toby Leaman at (323) 663-7441 or fax (323) 663-5715, for more \\ninformation on obtaining an insurance policy.  \\nOnce you have a lease signed by the landowner and liability insurance, you\\'re free to plan and plant your garden!  \\n9. Planning the Garden \\n \\nCommunity members should be involved in the planning, design, and set-up of the garden.  Before the design process begins, you \\nshould measure your site and make a simple, to-scale site map.  Hold two or three garden design meetings at times when interest ed \\nparticipants can attend.  Make sure that group decisions are re corded in official minutes, or that someone takes accurate notes .  This \\nensures that decisions made can be communicated to others, and progress will not be slowed.  A great way to generate ideas and \\nvisualize the design is to use simple drawings or photos cut from garden magazines representing the different garden components --\\nflower beds, compost bins, pathways, arbors, etc.--that can be moved around on the map as the group discusses layout.  \\na. Basic Elements of a Community Garden \\n \\nAlthough there are exceptions to every rule, co mmunity gardens should almost always include: \\n \\n• At least 15 plots assigned to community members.  These should be placed in the sunniest part of the garden.  Without plots f or \\nindividual participation, it is very difficult to achieve long-te rm community involvement.  Raised bed plots, which are more \\nexpensive, should be no more than 4 feet wide (to facilitate access to plants from the sides w ithout stepping into the bed), an d \\nbetween 8 and 12 feet long (it is advisable to construct your ra ised beds in sizes that are found in readily-available lumber, or that \\ncan be cut without too much waste).  In-ground plots can be from 10 x 10 up to 20 x 20 feet.  Pathways between beds and plots \\nshould be least 3 to 4 feet wide to allow space for wheelbarrows.  The soil in both raised bed and in-ground plots should be \\namended with aged compost or manure to improve its fertility and increase its organic matter content. \\n \\n• A simple irrigation system with one hose bib or faucet for every four plots.  Hand watering with a hose is the most practical  and \\naffordable for individual plots (and it\\'s al most a necessity when you start plants from  seed).  Drip and soaker-hose irrigation  can be \\nused in all areas of the garden for transplanted and establishe d plants, but especially for deep -rooted fruit trees and ornamen tals.  If \\nno one in your group is knowledgeable about irrigation, you might need some assistance in designing your irrigation system.  Se ek \\nout a landscape contractor or nursery or garden center professional to help you develop a basic layout and materials list. \\n \\n• An 8-foot fence around the perimeter with a drive-through gate .  In our experience, this is a key element of success.  Don\\'t \\ncount on eliminating all acts of vandalism or theft, but fencing will help to keep these to tolerably low levels.  \\n• A tool shed or other structure for storing tools, supplies, and materials.  Recycled metal shipping containers make excellent  \\nstorage sheds, and are almost vandal-proof.  Contact the Port Authority for leads on where to find them. \\n \\n• A bench or picnic table where gardeners can sit, relax, and take  a break--preferably in shade.  If there are no shade trees o n the \\nsite, a simple arbor can be constructed from wood or pipe, and planted with chayote squash, bougainvillea, grapes, kiwis, or so me \\nother vine.  \\n• A sign with the garden\\'s name, sponsors, and a contact person\\'s phone number for more information.  If your community is bilingual, include information in this language. \\n \\n• A shared composting area for the community  gardeners.  Wood pallets are easy to come-by and (when stood on-end, attached \\nin a U-shape, and the inside covered with galvanized rabbit-wire) make excellent compost bins.  \\nb. Nice Additions to Your Garden Plan \\n \\n• A small fruit tree orchard, whose care and harvest can be shared  by all the members.  The or chard can also create shade for \\npeople as well as shade-loving plants. \\n \\n• A water fountain.  This can be a simple drinking fountain attachment to a hose bib (or faucet) you can purchase at a hardware  \\nstore.  \\n• Perimeter landscaping, which can focus on drought tolerant  flowers and shrubs, plants which attract butterflies and \\nhummingbirds, or roses and other flowers suitable for cutting bou quets.  Herbs are also well-suited to perimeter landscaping an d \\nhelp to create barriers to unwanted pest insects who do not like the smell of their essential oils. \\n \\n• A children\\'s area, which can include special small pl ots for children, a sand box, and play equipment. \\n \\n• A meeting area, which could range from a semi-circle of hay ba les or tree stumps, to a simple amphitheater built of recycled,  \\nbroken concrete.  Building a shade struct ure above would be beneficial as well. \\n 4\\n \\n• A community bulletin board where rules, meeting notices, and other important information can be posted. \\n \\n10. Creating a Garden Budget  \\nUse your design to develop a materials list and cost-out the pr oject.  You will need to call-around to get prices on fencing an d other \\nitems.  You might be surprised at the cost.  A community garden with just the Basic Elements (listed above) typically costs bet ween \\n$2,500 to $5,000.  At this point, your group might decide to scale back your initial plans and save some design ideas for a \"Ph ase \\nTwo\" of the garden. \\n \\n11. Where to Get Materials and Money  \\nWhile some start-up funds will be needed through determination and hard work, you can obtain donations of materials for your project.  Community businesses might assist, and provide anything from fencing to lumber to plants.  The important thing is to ask.  \\nDevelop a letter that tells merchants about your project and why it\\'s important to the community.  Attach your \"wish list\", but  be \\nreasonable.  Try to personalize this letter for each business you approach.  Drop it off personally with the store manager, pre ferably \\nwith a couple of cute kids who will be gard ening in tow!  Then, follow-up by phone.  Be patient, persistent, and polite.  Your efforts \\nwill pay-off with at least some of the businesses you approach.  Be sure to thank these key supporters and recognize them on yo ur \\ngarden sign, at a garden grand opening, or other special event. \\n \\nMoney, which will be needed to purchase items not donated, can be  obtained through community fund-raisers such as car washes, \\ncraft and rummage sales, pancake breakfasts, and bake sales.  They can also be  obtained by writing grants, but be aware grant \\nwriting efforts can take six months or longer to yield results, an d you must have a fiscal sponsor or agent with tax-exempt 501 (c)3 \\nstatus (such as a church or non-profit corporation) that agrees to administer the funds. \\n \\n12. Make Sure Your Garden Infrastructure is in Place  \\nIf you have not yet formed a garden club, now is the time to do so.  It\\'s also time to establish garden rules, develop a garden  \\napplication form for those who wish to participate, set up a bank account, and determine what garden dues will be if these thin gs \\nhave not already been done.  This is also the time to begin having monthly meetings if you have not already done so.  Also, if you \\nhaven\\'t already contacted your city councilperson, he or she can be helpful in many ways including helping your group obtain ci ty \\nservices such as trash pick-up.  Their staff can also help you with community organizing and soliciting for material donations.  \\n \\n13.   Get Growing!  \\nMany new garden groups make the mistake of remaining in the planning, design and fundraising stage for an extended period of \\ntime.  There is a fine line between planning well and over plan ning.  After several months of the initial research, designing, \\nplanning, and outreach efforts, group members will very like ly be feeling frustrated and will begin to wonder if all their effo rts will \\never result in a garden.  That\\'s why it\\'s important to plant something on your site as soon as possible.  People need to see vi sible \\nresults or they will begin to lose interest in the project.  To keep the momentum going, initiate the following steps even if y ou are \\nstill seeking donations and funds or your project (but not until you have signed a lease and obtained insurance).  \\na. Clean up the Site \\nSchedule community workdays to clean up the site.  How many work days you need will depend on the size of the site, and how \\nmuch and what kind of debris are on site.   \\n \\nb. Install the Irrigation System \\nWithout water, you can\\'t grow anything.  So get this key element into place as soon as possible.  There are plenty of opportuni ties \\nfor community involvement--from digging trenches to laying out PVC pipes. \\n \\nc. Plant Something \\nOnce you have water, there are many options for in-garden action.  Stake out beds and pathways by marking them with stakes and \\ntwine.  Mulch pathways.  If your fence is n\\'t in yet, some people might still want to accept the risk of vandalism and get their  plots \\nstarted.  You can also plant shade and fruit trees and begin to landscape the site.  If you do not yet have a source of donated  plants, \\nor don\\'t wish to risk having them vandalized, plant annual flower  seeds which will grow quickly and can be replaced later.  See ds \\nfor Los Angeles County community and school gardens can be obtained through the Common Ground Garden Program (323) 260-\\n3348.  \\nd. Continue to construct the garden as  materials and funds become available. \\n \\n14. Celebrate!  \\nAt this point, your ideas and hard work have finally become a community garden!  Be sure to take time to celebrate.  Have a gra nd \\nopening, barbecue, or some other fun event to give everyone who helped to make this happen, a special thank-you.  This is the t ime \\nto give all those who gave donated materials or time a sp ecial certificate, bouquet, or other form of recognition. \\n \\n15. Troubleshooting as the Garden Develops  \\n 5\\nAll community gardens will experience problems somewhere along  the way.  Don\\'t get discourage--get organized.  The key \\nto success for community gardens is not only preventing problems from ever occurring, but also working together to solve them \\nwhen they do inevitably occur.  In our experience, these are some of the most common problems that \"crop-up\" in community \\ngardens, and our suggestions for solving them  \\na. Vandalism \\nMost gardens experience occasional vandalism.  The best action you can take is to replant immediately.  Generally the vandals \\nbecome bored after a while and st op.  Good community outr each, especially to youth and the ga rden\\'s immediately neighbors is al so \\nimportant.  Most important--don\\'t get to discouraged.  It happens.  Get over it and keep going.  What about barbed wired or raz or \\nwire to make the garden more secure?  Our advice--don\\'t.  It\\'s  bad for community relations, looks awful, and is sometimes illeg al to \\ninstall without a permit.  If you need more physical deterrents to keep vandals out, plant bougainvillea or pyracantha along yo ur \\nfence, their thorns will do the trick!  \\nb. Security \\nInvite the community officer from your local precinct to a garden meeting to get their suggestions on making the garden more \\nsecure.  Community officers can also be a great help in solving problems with garden vandalism, and dealing with drug dealers, and \\ngang members in the area.  \\nc. Communication \\nClear and well-enforced garden rules and a strong garden president can go a long way towards minimizing misunderstandings in th e \\ngarden.  But communication problems do arise.  It\\'s the job of the garden club to resolve those issues.  If it\\'s something not clearly \\nspelled out in the rules, the membership can take a vote to add new rules and make modifications to existing rules.  \\nLanguage barriers are a very common source of misunderstandings.  Garden club leadership should make every effort to have a \\ntranslator at garden meetings where partic ipants are bilingual--perhaps a family member  of one of the garden members who speaks  \\nthe language will offer to help.  \\nd. Trash \\nIt\\'s important to get your compost system going right away and get some training for gardeners on how to use it.  If gardeners don\\'t \\ncompost, large quantities of waste will begin to build up, create an eyesore, and could hurt your  relationships with neighbors and the \\nproperty owner.  Waste can also become a fire hazard.  Make su re gardeners know how to sort trash properly, what to compost, an d \\nwhat to recycle.  Trash cans placed in accessible areas are helpful to keep  a neat and tidy garden. \\n \\ne. Gardener Drop-Out \\nThere has been, and probably always will be, a high rate of turn over in community gardens.  Often, people sign up for plots and  \\nthen don\\'t follow through.  Remember, gardening is hard work for so me people, especially in the heat  of summer.  Be sure to hav e a \\nclause in your gardener agreement which stat es gardeners forfeit their right to their plot if they don\\'t plant it within one mo nth, or if \\nthey don\\'t maintain it.  While gardeners should be given ever y opportunity to follow through, if after several reminders either  by \\nletter or phone nothing changes, it is time for the club to reassi gn the plot.  It is also advi sable that every year, the leade rship \\nconduct a renewed community outreach campaig n by contacting churches and other groups in the neighborhood to let them know \\nabout the garden and that  plots are available.  \\nf. Weeds \\nGardeners tend to visit their plots less during the winter time, and lower participation, combined with rain, tends to create a  huge \\nweed problem in January, February, and March.   Remember, part of your agreement with  the landowner is that you will maintain \\nthe lot and keep weeds from taking over.  In the late summer/ear ly fall, provide gardeners with a workshop or printed material about \\nwhat can be grown in a fall and winter garden.  Also, schedule garden workdays for the spring in advance since you know you\\'ll \\nneed them at the end of winter to clear weeds.  If you anticip ate that plots will be untended during the winter, apply a thick layer of \\nmulch or hay to the beds and paths to reduce weed proliferation.  \\nGood luck with your community garden project!   \\nYvonne Savio, Common Ground Garden Program Manager, University of California Cooperative Extension, Los Angeles County \\n4800 E.

      " This Community Garden Start-Up Guide is intended to help neighborhood groups and organizations along the path to starting \n",
      "and sustaining a community garden. \n",
      "Why Start a Community Garden?  \n",
      " Many families living in the city would like to grow some of their own fruits, vegetables, herbs, and flowers.  Some want to sa ve \n",
      "money on their food bills.  Others like the freshness, flavor an d wholesomeness of home-grown produce.  And for many, gardening  is \n",
      "a relaxing way to exercise and enjoy being out-of-doors.  There are also families from other cultures who would like to grow \n",
      "traditional foods not available in the supermarket.  \n",
      " Community gardens beautify neighborhoods and help bring neighbors closer together.  They have been proven as tools to reduce neighborhood crime--particularly when vacant, blighted lots are targeted for garden development.  Community gardens provide saf e, \n",
      "recreational green space in urban areas with little or no park land, and can contribute greatly  to keeping urban air clean. \n",
      " \n",
      " Those who are lucky enough to have sunny backyards or balconies can plant a garden whenever they  have the time and energy.  \n",
      "But what about those who do not have a place to garden?  For these people, community gardens may be the answer. \n",
      " \n",
      "Step by Step To Your Own Community Garden  \n",
      "1. Get Your Neighbors Involved  \n",
      "There is a lot of work involved in starting a new garden.  Make  sure you have several people who will help you.  Over the years , our \n",
      "experience indicates that there should be at least ten interested families to cr eate and sustain a garden project.  Survey the residents of \n",
      "your neighborhood to see if they are interested and would participate.  Hold monthly meetings of the interested group to develo p and \n",
      "initiate plans, keep people posted on the garden's progress, and keep them involved in the process from day one.  \n",
      "2. Form a Garden Club  \n",
      "A garden club is a way of formally organizing your new group.  It helps you make decisions and divide-up the work effectively.  It \n",
      "also ensures that every one has a vested interest in the garden and can contribute to its design, development, and maintenance.   It can \n",
      "be formed at any time during the process of  starting a community garden; however, it's wi se to do so early on.  This way, club \n",
      "members can share in the many tasks of establishing the new gard en.  The typical garden club will have many functions, includin g: \n",
      "• Establishing garden rules (see sample) \n",
      "• Accepting and reviewing garden applications \n",
      "• Making plot assignments \n",
      "• Collecting garden dues (if any) \n",
      "• Paying water bills \n",
      "• Resolving conflicts \n",
      "The typical garden club has at least two officers:  a president and a treasurer; although your garden club may have more if nec essary.  \n",
      "Elections for garden officers usually are held annually.   \n",
      " \n",
      " 2\n",
      "Find Land for the Garden \n",
      " \n",
      "Look around your neighbor hood for a vacant lo t that gets plenty of sun--at least six to  eight hours each day.  A garden site sh ould be \n",
      "relatively flat (although slight slopes ca n be terraced).  It should be relatively fr ee of large pieces of concrete left behind  from \n",
      "demolition of structures.  Any rubble or debris should be manageable--that is, it can be removed by volunteers clearing the lot  with \n",
      "trash bags, wheelbarrows, and pick up trucks.  Ideally, it should have a fence around it with a gate wide enough for a vehicle to \n",
      "enter.  It is possible to work with a site that is paved with  concrete or asphalt by building raised beds that sit on the surfa ce or using \n",
      "containers.  You can also remove the asphalt or concrete to cr eate areas for gardens, but such a garden will be much more diffi cult, \n",
      "expensive, and time-consuming to start.  A site without pa ving, and soil relatively free of trash and debris is best. \n",
      " \n",
      "The potential garden site should be within walking, or no more  than a short drive from you and the neighbors who have expressed  \n",
      "interest in participating.  If the lot is not already being used , make sure the community supports establishing a garden there.  \n",
      " \n",
      "It's best to select three potential sites in your neighborhood and write down their address and ne arest cross streets.  If you don't know \n",
      "the address of a vacant lot, get the addresses of the properti es on both sides of the lot--this will give you the ability to ma ke an \n",
      "educated guess on the address of the site.  We suggest you identify at least three potential sites b ecause one or more might no t be \n",
      "available for you to use for various reasons, and you want to end up with at least one that works out. \n",
      " \n",
      "3. Find out Who Owns the Land \n",
      " \n",
      "It is illegal to use land without obtaining the owners permission.  In order to obtain permission, you must first find out who owns the \n",
      "land. \n",
      " \n",
      "Take the information you have written down about the location of th e sites in step 3 to your county's tax assessor's office.  T he Los \n",
      "Angeles County Tax Assessor's office is located at 225 North Hill Street, Room 205.  Or go to a branch office listed in the whi te \n",
      "pages of the telephone directory.  At this office, you will look  through the map books to get the names and addresses of the ow ner of \n",
      "the sites you are interested in. \n",
      " \n",
      "4. Find out if Your Proposed Site has Water \n",
      " \n",
      "While you are researching site ownership, contact the water servi ce provider in your area to fi nd out if your potential site(s)  \n",
      "has/have an existing water meter to hook-in to.  Call your water provider's customer service department, and ask them to conduc t a \n",
      "site investigation.  They will need the same location inform ation that you took with you to the Tax Asse ssor's office. \n",
      " \n",
      "Existing access to water will make a critical difference in the expense of getting your project started.  Depending on the size  of your \n",
      "garden site, you will need a 1/2-inch to 1-inch water meter.  If there has been water service to the site in the past, it is re latively \n",
      "inexpensive to get a new water meter installed (if one doesn't al ready exist).  If there has never been water service to that s ite, it \n",
      "might cost much more for your water provider to install a lateral line from the street main to the site and install your new me ter. \n",
      " \n",
      "5 Contact the Land Owner \n",
      " \n",
      "Once you have determined that your potential site is feasible, write a letter to the landowner asking for permission to use the  \n",
      "property for a community garden.  Be sure to mention to the landowner the value of the garden to the community and the fact the  \n",
      "gardeners will be responsible for keeping the site clean and weed -free (this saves landowners from maintaining the site or payi ng \n",
      "city weed abatement fees).  \n",
      "Establish a term for use of the site, and prepare and negotiate a lease.  Typically, groups lease garden sites from land owners  for $1 \n",
      "per year.  You should attempt to negotiate a lease for a least thr ee years (or longer if the proper ty owner is agreeable).  Man y \n",
      "landowners are worried about their liability for injuries that mi ght occur at the garden.  Therefore, you should include a simp le hold \n",
      "harmless waiver in the lease and in gardener agreement forms.  For more information on the lease, and the hold harmless waiver , \n",
      "see 8, Signing a Lease.  \n",
      "Be prepared to purchase liability insuran ce to protect further the property owner (and  yourself) should an accident occur at th e \n",
      "garden.  For more information on the hold harmless waiver, and liability insurance, see 8, Signing a Lease, and 9, Obtaining  \n",
      "Liability Insurance. \n",
      " \n",
      "6. Get Your Soil Tested \n",
      " \n",
      "It might be advisable to have the soil at the site tested for fertility pH and presence of hea vy metals.  Contact a private lab . \n",
      " \n",
      "7. Signing a Lease \n",
      " \n",
      "Landowners of potential garden sites might be concerned abou t their liability should someone be injured while working in the \n",
      "garden.  Your group should be prepared to offer the landowner a lease with a hold harmless waiver.  This hold harmless waiv er \n",
      "can simply state that should one of the ga rdeners be injured as a result of negligence  on the part of another gardener, the lan downer \n",
      "is held harmless and will not be sued.  Each gardener should be made aware of this waiver and sh ould be required to sign an \n",
      " 3\n",
      "agreement in order to obtain a plot in the community garden.  A sample gardener agreement form is attached which your \n",
      "group can use as a model.  \n",
      "8. Obtaining Liability Insurance \n",
      " \n",
      "Landowners may also require that your group purchase liabilit y insurance.  Community gardeners in the Los Angeles area can \n",
      "obtain inexpensive policies from Metro Farm Gardens.  Contact Toby Leaman at (323) 663-7441 or fax (323) 663-5715, for more \n",
      "information on obtaining an insurance policy.  \n",
      "Once you have a lease signed by the landowner and liability insurance, you're free to plan and plant your garden!  \n",
      "9. Planning the Garden \n",
      " \n",
      "Community members should be involved in the planning, design, and set-up of the garden.  Before the design process begins, you \n",
      "should measure your site and make a simple, to-scale site map.  Hold two or three garden design meetings at times when interest ed \n",
      "participants can attend.  Make sure that group decisions are re corded in official minutes, or that someone takes accurate notes .  This \n",
      "ensures that decisions made can be communicated to others, and progress will not be slowed.  A great way to generate ideas and \n",
      "visualize the design is to use simple drawings or photos cut from garden magazines representing the different garden components --\n",
      "flower beds, compost bins, pathways, arbors, etc.--that can be moved around on the map as the group discusses layout.  \n",
      "a. Basic Elements of a Community Garden \n",
      " \n",
      "Although there are exceptions to every rule, co mmunity gardens should almost always include: \n",
      " \n",
      "• At least 15 plots assigned to community members.  These should be placed in the sunniest part of the garden.  Without plots f or \n",
      "individual participation, it is very difficult to achieve long-te rm community involvement.  Raised bed plots, which are more \n",
      "expensive, should be no more than 4 feet wide (to facilitate access to plants from the sides w ithout stepping into the bed), an d \n",
      "between 8 and 12 feet long (it is advisable to construct your ra ised beds in sizes that are found in readily-available lumber, or that \n",
      "can be cut without too much waste).  In-ground plots can be from 10 x 10 up to 20 x 20 feet.  Pathways between beds and plots \n",
      "should be least 3 to 4 feet wide to allow space for wheelbarrows.  The soil in both raised bed and in-ground plots should be \n",
      "amended with aged compost or manure to improve its fertility and increase its organic matter content. \n",
      " \n",
      "• A simple irrigation system with one hose bib or faucet for every four plots.  Hand watering with a hose is the most practical  and \n",
      "affordable for individual plots (and it's al most a necessity when you start plants from  seed).  Drip and soaker-hose irrigation  can be \n",
      "used in all areas of the garden for transplanted and establishe d plants, but especially for deep -rooted fruit trees and ornamen tals.  If \n",
      "no one in your group is knowledgeable about irrigation, you might need some assistance in designing your irrigation system.  Se ek \n",
      "out a landscape contractor or nursery or garden center professional to help you develop a basic layout and materials list. \n",
      " \n",
      "• An 8-foot fence around the perimeter with a drive-through gate .  In our experience, this is a key element of success.  Don't \n",
      "count on eliminating all acts of vandalism or theft, but fencing will help to keep these to tolerably low levels.  \n",
      "• A tool shed or other structure for storing tools, supplies, and materials.  Recycled metal shipping containers make excellent  \n",
      "storage sheds, and are almost vandal-proof.  Contact the Port Authority for leads on where to find them. \n",
      " \n",
      "• A bench or picnic table where gardeners can sit, relax, and take  a break--preferably in shade.  If there are no shade trees o n the \n",
      "site, a simple arbor can be constructed from wood or pipe, and planted with chayote squash, bougainvillea, grapes, kiwis, or so me \n",
      "other vine.  \n",
      "• A sign with the garden's name, sponsors, and a contact person's phone number for more information.  If your community is bilingual, include information in this language. \n",
      " \n",
      "• A shared composting area for the community  gardeners.  Wood pallets are easy to come-by and (when stood on-end, attached \n",
      "in a U-shape, and the inside covered with galvanized rabbit-wire) make excellent compost bins.  \n",
      "b. Nice Additions to Your Garden Plan \n",
      " \n",
      "• A small fruit tree orchard, whose care and harvest can be shared  by all the members.  The or chard can also create shade for \n",
      "people as well as shade-loving plants. \n",
      " \n",
      "• A water fountain.  This can be a simple drinking fountain attachment to a hose bib (or faucet) you can purchase at a hardware  \n",
      "store.  \n",
      "• Perimeter landscaping, which can focus on drought tolerant  flowers and shrubs, plants which attract butterflies and \n",
      "hummingbirds, or roses and other flowers suitable for cutting bou quets.  Herbs are also well-suited to perimeter landscaping an d \n",
      "help to create barriers to unwanted pest insects who do not like the smell of their essential oils. \n",
      " \n",
      "• A children's area, which can include special small pl ots for children, a sand box, and play equipment. \n",
      " \n",
      "• A meeting area, which could range from a semi-circle of hay ba les or tree stumps, to a simple amphitheater built of recycled,  \n",
      "broken concrete.  Building a shade struct ure above would be beneficial as well. \n",
      " 4\n",
      " \n",
      "• A community bulletin board where rules, meeting notices, and other important information can be posted. \n",
      " \n",
      "10. Creating a Garden Budget  \n",
      "Use your design to develop a materials list and cost-out the pr oject.  You will need to call-around to get prices on fencing an d other \n",
      "items.  You might be surprised at the cost.  A community garden with just the Basic Elements (listed above) typically costs bet ween \n",
      "$2,500 to $5,000.  At this point, your group might decide to scale back your initial plans and save some design ideas for a Ph ase \n",
      "Two of the garden. \n",
      " \n",
      "11. Where to Get Materials and Money  \n",
      "While some start-up funds will be needed through determination and hard work, you can obtain donations of materials for your project.  Community businesses might assist, and provide anything from fencing to lumber to plants.  The important thing is to ask.  \n",
      "Develop a letter that tells merchants about your project and why it's important to the community.  Attach your wish list, but  be \n",
      "reasonable.  Try to personalize this letter for each business you approach.  Drop it off personally with the store manager, pre ferably \n",
      "with a couple of cute kids who will be gard ening in tow!  Then, follow-up by phone.  Be patient, persistent, and polite.  Your efforts \n",
      "will pay-off with at least some of the businesses you approach.  Be sure to thank these key supporters and recognize them on yo ur \n",
      "garden sign, at a garden grand opening, or other special event. \n",
      " \n",
      "Money, which will be needed to purchase items not donated, can be  obtained through community fund-raisers such as car washes, \n",
      "craft and rummage sales, pancake breakfasts, and bake sales.  They can also be  obtained by writing grants, but be aware grant \n",
      "writing efforts can take six months or longer to yield results, an d you must have a fiscal sponsor or agent with tax-exempt 501 (c)3 \n",
      "status (such as a church or non-profit corporation) that agrees to administer the funds. \n",
      " \n",
      "12. Make Sure Your Garden Infrastructure is in Place  \n",
      "If you have not yet formed a garden club, now is the time to do so.  It's also time to establish garden rules, develop a garden  \n",
      "application form for those who wish to participate, set up a bank account, and determine what garden dues will be if these thin gs \n",
      "have not already been done.  This is also the time to begin having monthly meetings if you have not already done so.  Also, if you \n",
      "haven't already contacted your city councilperson, he or she can be helpful in many ways including helping your group obtain ci ty \n",
      "services such as trash pick-up.  Their staff can also help you with community organizing and soliciting for material donations.  \n",
      " \n",
      "13.   Get Growing!  \n",
      "Many new garden groups make the mistake of remaining in the planning, design and fundraising stage for an extended period of \n",
      "time.  There is a fine line between planning well and over plan ning.  After several months of the initial research, designing, \n",
      "planning, and outreach efforts, group members will very like ly be feeling frustrated and will begin to wonder if all their effo rts will \n",
      "ever result in a garden.  That's why it's important to plant something on your site as soon as possible.  People need to see vi sible \n",
      "results or they will begin to lose interest in the project.  To keep the momentum going, initiate the following steps even if y ou are \n",
      "still seeking donations and funds or your project (but not until you have signed a lease and obtained insurance).  \n",
      "a. Clean up the Site \n",
      "Schedule community workdays to clean up the site.  How many work days you need will depend on the size of the site, and how \n",
      "much and what kind of debris are on site.   \n",
      " \n",
      "b. Install the Irrigation System \n",
      "Without water, you can't grow anything.  So get this key element into place as soon as possible.  There are plenty of opportuni ties \n",
      "for community involvement--from digging trenches to laying out PVC pipes. \n",
      " \n",
      "c. Plant Something \n",
      "Once you have water, there are many options for in-garden action.  Stake out beds and pathways by marking them with stakes and \n",
      "twine.  Mulch pathways.  If your fence is n't in yet, some people might still want to accept the risk of vandalism and get their  plots \n",
      "started.  You can also plant shade and fruit trees and begin to landscape the site.  If you do not yet have a source of donated  plants, \n",
      "or don't wish to risk having them vandalized, plant annual flower  seeds which will grow quickly and can be replaced later.  See ds \n",

Thank you!Purposes and SummaryThe purposes of the California Homegrown Food Act are to:1) Increase access to fresh, locally sourced produce for all Californians regardless of location and other socioeconomic limitations;2) Allow individuals to supplement their incomes through sale of produce grown at home or on other urban or suburban land; and3) Reduce the carbon footprint of our food system by enabling the increased cultivation of produce in or near places it is consumed.The Act will achieve these purposes by ensuring the rights of individuals and groups to cultivate and, in certain cases, sell edible plants. The Act will remove a handful of barriers arising from local zoning laws, private land covenants, and lease restrictions.  Producers must, however, still comply with any and all relevant health, agricultural, and environmental regulations.  The Act will specify the types of allowable food production practices and basis for regulation by defining three types of food growing activities and specifying reasonable limits and regulations thereof.Findings and DeclarationsThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:a) California industrial agriculture is at risk due to water shortages, soil degradation, pollution, environmental and structural threats to the San Francisco Bay Delta, and the rising cost of oil.  A food shortage from these problems is a real and imminent threat. Providing Californians with the capacity to feed themselves and their communities would drastically improve local food security and mediate the risks of  water, soil, environmental, or fuel-related crises.b) Though California is the “bread basket” of the United States and has regions of climate and land ideal for agriculture, a significant amount of California’s food is grown hundreds or thousands of miles from where it is consumed. This results in high transportation costs, energy consumption, and lost economic opportunity for our state. Even food grown in the heart of California’s farming region is expensive to disperse to the rest of the state due to rising fuel costs.c) California is no exception to rising U.S. obesity and obesity-related diseases.  It is important to note that:1. Two-thirds of American adults and nearly one-third of American children are obese or overweight, putting them at risk for developing chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, or cancer.2. One in every nine California children, one in three teens, and over half of adults are already overweight or obese. This epidemic affects virtually all Californians.3. These health conditions are preventable and curable through lifestyle choices that include consumption of healthy fresh foods.d) One of every ten dollars spent on health care in the United States goes toward treating diabetes and its complications. Facilitating opportunities for California residents to grow and consume fresh, healthy foods will promote lifestyles and diets that benefit individuals and communities, as well as more effective use of public dollars.e) Many homeowners associations have rules prohibiting homeowners from growing food in front yards or from selling food grown on the property.f) Additionally, approximately 40% of Californians are renters and may, as a result of lease restrictions or disapproval by the landlord, face limitations on their ability to grow food on the land where they reside.g) Providing Californians with increased opportunity to participate in small-scale entrepreneurial agriculture will supplement incomes during times of high unemployment and under-employment and stimulate local economies.DefinitionsAs used in this Act, the following types of uses shall be defined as follows:Personal Agriculture:A use specific to residential zones in which individuals cultivate produce at their own residence for personal consumption or donation.Community Garden:A use in which land managed by a public entity, nonprofit organization, individual, or group of individuals is used to cultivate produce for donation or for personal consumption by those cultivating the land.EntrepreneurialAgriculture:A use in which land managed by a public entity, nonprofit organization, business entity, individual, or group of individuals is used to cultivate produce for the purpose of sale.Produce:Raw, unprocessed fruits, vegetables, herbs, and nuts.Portion of the Bill Addressing Local Zoning LawsThe California Government Code shall be amended to require that city and county governments allow the following agricultural uses, subject to the following regulations and restrictions:Personal Agriculturea. Where Personal Agricultureshall bepermitted:Personal Agriculture shall be considered an accessory use in residential zones.b. Allowable Regulations of Personal Agriculture:Zoning regulations may not prohibit the cultivation of food plants in front or back yards for personal use.  However, cities may make reasonable restrictions pertaining to height of plant material and the  presence of dead plant material in  front yards.  Note that cities may not restrict the use of dead plant material that is to be used as ground cover, mulch, or compost.  Cities may adopt regulations to restrict plants that could interfere with a public sidewalk.Community Gardens:a. Where Community Gardensshall bepermitted:1.  In residential zones:Community Gardens shall be a permitted use.2. In commercial zones:Community Gardens shall be a permitted use.3. In industrial zones:Community Gardens shall be a permitted use.b. Allowable Regulation of Community Gardens:Any structures for community gardening may be subject to the development standards of the zone as they apply to accessory structuresEntrepreneurialAgriculture:a. Where Entrepreneurial Agricultureshall bepermitted:1. In residential zones:Entrepreneurial Agriculture shall be a permitted use in residential zones and shall be considered an accessory use to a residence.  However, any food plant cultivation for Entrepreneurial Agriculture purposes that occupies more than 5,000 square feet of land may be required by a city or county to obtain a conditional use permit. Entrepreneurial Agriculture in residential areas may be subject to the following additional restrictions:A. Only mechanical equipment designed for household use may be used.B. Retail sales and all other public use of the farm shall begin no earlier than 7 a.m. and end by 7 p.m. every day of the week.C. Commercial deliveries and pickups are limited to one per day. On-site sales are not considered commercial pickups.D.  One identification sign is permitted, not exceeding 64 square inches in area.2. In commercial zones:Entrepreneurial Agriculture shall be a permitted use.3. In industrial zones:Entrepreneurial Agriculture shall be a permitted use.b. Regulations on Entrepreneurial Agriculture:In all zones, odor, noise, and dust caused by Entrepreneurial Agriculture may be limited to “what a reasonable individual can tolerate” at a distance of more than 100 feet from site of the Entrepreneurial Agriculture activity.Portion of the Bill Addressing Homeowners AssociationsSection 1353.10 is added to the California Civil Code, to read:a. Notwithstanding any other law, a provision of any of the governing documents of a common interest development shall be void and unenforceable if it does any of the following:1. Prohibits, or includes conditions that have the effect of prohibiting, the use of a Homeowner’s front or back yard, for Personal Agriculture or Entrepreneurial Agriculture.2. Prohibits, or includes conditions that have the effect of prohibiting, a Homeowner from theoff-sitesale or donation of produce grown on the Homeowner’s property.b. This section applies only to yards that are designated for the exclusive use of the Homeowner.c. This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations restrictingon-sitesale of agricultural products.e. This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations restricting the hours of operation and the number of visitors to gardens within the association.f. This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations requiring that dead plant material and weeds, with the exception of straw, mulch, and other organic materials intended to encourage vegetation and retention of moisture in the soil, are regularly cleared from the front yard.g. This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations requiring that gardens and crops do not grow more than six feet in height to preserve aesthetic appeal and cleanliness.Portion of the Bill Addressing Tenant Food CultivationApproximately40% of Californians live in residences that they do not own, which means that such tenants may have restricted rights to cultivate food, depending on what is permitted by the landlord and the lease agreement.  This Act would give tenants some rights to cultivate food, so long as such cultivation does not unreasonably interfere with existing landscaping or with common area uses by other tenants.Definitions:“Common area” refers to an area of the property that is shared with other tenants.“Private area” refers to an area of the property that is for the exclusive use of a tenant.The Act would protect the ability of tenants to cultivate and sell food, as follows:a.  A landlord shall allow a tenant to participate in Personal Agriculture or Entrepreneurial Agriculture under the following circumstances:1.Container Plants:A tenant may cultivate food plants in containers, so long as:A. The tenant regularly removes any dead plant material and weeds.B. The placement of the containers does not interfere with any existing plants.C. The placement of the containers does not interfere with any tenant’s parking spot.D. The placement of the containers does not create a trip-and-fall hazard.E. The placement of the containers does not cause water damage to any portion of the property.F. If the containers are to be placed on top of grass, the landlord may require the tenant to re-plant grass prior to vacating the property.2.Plants in the Ground or Raised Beds:A tenant may cultivate food plants in the ground or in a raised bed, so long as:A. The tenant agrees to restore or pay for the restoration of any landscaping roughly to its original condition when the tenant vacates the property or ceases to engage in food cultivation.B. The  tenant regularly removes any dead plant material and weeds for the food cultivation area.C. The tenant must not leave any hazards in the common area, including holes or gardening tools.3.Impact on Neighbors and Other Tenants:A tenant may not engage in gardening activities in any common areas before 7:00am or after 9:00pm; gardening activities must not interfere with the quiet enjoyment of other residents and neighbors. If the landlord determines, due to complaints from other residents, that the garden area is interfering with the rights of other tenants or neighbors with respect to their quiet enjoyment of the property, the landlord may terminate the tenant’s gardening rights, with 30 days written notice. The notice must explain the basis for termination of gardening rights. Such notice does not constitute a notice of termination of tenancy.4.Gardening in Common Areas:If the gardening is done in common areas, other residents must be notified in writing 15 days prior to the commencement of any food cultivation activity and given an opportunity to bring their concerns to the landlord’s attention. If more than 25% of the tenants object to the gardening activity in the common area and if their concerns are not addressed through a change in the gardening plan, then the landlord may prohibit the food cultivation activity in the common area.5.Restoration of Landscaping:With the exception of container plants on paved areas, the landlord may choose to require an additional security deposit to ensure that all landscaping may be restored after the tenant vacates the property or ceases to engage in food cultivation.6.Payment of Water and Waste Collection Bills:A landlord may require the tenant to enter into a written agreement regarding the payment of any excess water and waste collection bills stemming from the garden.7.Inspection Rights:The landlord has a right to periodically inspect the garden area to ensure compliance with the above rules.8.Off-Site Sales:The landlord may not prevent tenants from selling products derived from this gardening at an off-site location.b. Furthermore, a landlord may prohibit a tenant from engaging in Entrepreneurial Agriculture, unless the tenant demonstrates that the Entrepreneurial Agriculture operations maintain in force either liability insurance covering injury to clients and guests in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) per occurrence and three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) in the total annual aggregate, sustained on account of the negligence of the licensee or its employees, or a bond in the aggregate amount of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000).ShareEmailPrintFacebookLinkedInTumblrTwitterPinterestRedditDiggPocketGoogleStumbleUpon\n"

      "Gardening is becoming more popular in every corner of the country. Rather than taking care of houseplants, people are focusing on growing food.\n",
      "Urban gardening in Los Angeles is a great way to grow fresh produce for yourself or tosell at farmers markets. Whether you hope to grow a personal garden for fresh produce, join a community garden, or create an urban garden with other residents, Los Angeles is the place. It has a long growing season that’s perfect for producing a variety of vegetables and herbs.\n",
      "Read this comprehensive guide to get started!\n",
      "Can you make a profit from your urban garden?\n",
      "Yes! Some urban gardeners sell fresh vegetables and herbs to local businesses or at farmers markets.\n",
      "People plant urban gardens for a variety of reasons. For example, your garden could provide food for you and your family. Alternatively, maybe you’ll share the produce with the local community for a profit. Either way, your goal will be an important factor in planning the size, location, and types of plants for your urban garden. As a result, understanding your options will help you determine the future of your urban garden.\n",
      "A personal urban garden is one that’s meant to provide fresh food for you and your family. You might save money on your weekly grocery run, but you aren’t generating a profit from personal urban gardening. There are a variety of ways to grow food for your family in Los Angeles, even for city dwellers with only a small amount of space. Those options include:\n",
      "People are earning $1,000s per year from their garages and outdoor space.\n",
      "You're in control. Approve who rents and the hours of access.\n",
      "Sit back and collect automatic payments each month.\n",
      "Depending on the amount of space you have available, any containers deep enough to let plants grow roots — around 10 -12 inches — can be used for plants. You’ll simply need to put holes in the bottom to allow the soil to drain properly.\n",
      "If you have yard space to grow vegetables, thena raised bed gardencan help you avoid weeds. Raised beds can also be used on concrete patios or sidewalks. Raised beds can be built on sloping land, as well.\n",
      "Some community gardens are designed for growing commercial vegetables only. However, others allow residents to rent spaces within them for personal use. There are over 100 community gardens in Los Angeles (and we’ll discuss them later in this article).\n",
      "A vertical urban garden is a type of container garden that uses vertical space to compensate for small areas. Tiered containers, hanging pots, and trellises, for example, may be used to help plants use vertical space.\n",
      "If you have very little space, then planter boxes are an option for growing small plants. Typically used for herbs or flowers, these boxes are placed directly outside a window for easy plant watering and care.\n",
      "A commercial urban garden is designed for growing produce you want to sell. Starting a vegetable garden can help you make money from home. Small urban gardens also need only a relatively small start-up investment.\n",
      "If you don’t have the space for a garden at home, then there are other urban farming solutions you can try. Many people participate in a community garden, for example, to provide local vegetables to the area andgenerate an extra income stream. These are a few ways you can get started growing an urban garden in Los Angeles to generate a profit:\n",
      "Even if you don’t use your entire yard, you can make a profit from vegetables you grow in your yard space. Maximize your yield with vertical gardening techniques, raised beds, and companion planting. If you’re short on space, then you can even grow herbs on a windowsill.\n",
      "Some community gardens are nonprofit organizations. Therefore, they depend on volunteers to grow food for donations. Others provide rental plots that allow you to grow vegetables and herbs for your consumption or for a profit.\n",
      "Whether you’re growing vegetables for your family’s health or in hopes of creating a revenue stream, start small. This can help you avoid getting overwhelmed.\n",
      "The climate in Los Angeles, California, provides one of the longest growing seasons in the country. When you’re choosing plants for an urban garden, you’ll also need to consider which months you’ll be planting and how much time you want to spend gardening.\n",
      "If you’re growing a garden for personal use, then starting small with the vegetables you like most can provide added incentive to succeed. Also, vegetables for commercial gardens should have a shorter growing period for maximum profit. Thisguidewill help you decide when to plant seedlings in your urban garden.\n",
      "Los Angeles planting zones range from 7 to 11, which means many plants can be planted in early spring. Some options and their planting months are:\n",
      "Many types of vegetables can be grown during California’s summer season if you have a good watering system and avoid too much full sun exposure. Extend the spring growth season with:\n",
      "As summer turns to fall, cooler air promotes better growth. Try urban gardening with these plants because they can keep producing through late fall:\n",
      "Winter vegetables can be planted in late September and into October. Some good vegetable options are:\n",
      "In the absence of frost, vegetables can even be grown or harvested during November and December. So you can also try planting these veggies in the late fall:\n",
      "If you intend to plant more vegetables immediately after harvesting, then choose plants from a different crop family. Rotating crop families can help you avoid garden diseases or poor soil quality.\n",
      "Fresh herbs can complement any meal. They can also provide pest control when grown alongside organic vegetables. These herbs grow well in California’s dry climate:\n",
      "\n",
      "The vegetables you choose to plant will inevitably be determined by more than their seasons and planting schedules. After all, you probably want to grow the vegetables you love so you can enjoy them. However, if you plan to sell vegetables, it’s important to consider planting cycles and the plants that will sell best in your area. Choosing the right plants and creative planting techniques will help you make the most of limited space.\n",

Urban gardens can be an introduction to a healthier lifestyle and even generate a profit.

Each community  garden  will have its own written  \\ngarden  rules based  on the specific  needs  and circumstances  of the community.  As \\nthe garden  is a shared  space,  it is necessary  that gardeners  agree  to observe  a set \\nof rules regarding  how to maintain  their assigned  plots and shared  areas  as well as \\ncultivate positive relationships.  The following  sample garden rules are for \\nconsideration  to be used as a starting  point.\\nGarden  Hours,  Maintenance,  and Tools\\nGardeners  may access  the garden  from sunrise  to sundown  daily, year-  \\nround.  Gardeners  are responsible  for locking  the gate behind  them. Keys and \\ncombinations  are strictly  for personal  use and must not be shared  with others.\\ndays of the plot being assigned.1.\\n2. Gardeners  must plant their plot within  \\nThey  must garden  year-round.\\nIf gardeners  are unable  to tend the plot due to illness or traveling,  they must  \\narrange  for someone  else to tend the plot and notify the Garden  Leadership  \\nTeam.3.\\nGardeners  must keep their plot, paths, and surrounding  areas around  their plot \\nclean and free of trash, weeds,  and debris.

We have posted a summary of the bill here in order to seek feedback. \\xa0Please post a comment letting us know your thoughts on the proposal below, or email Janelle.SELC [at] gmail.com with your questions and comments. Thank you!Purposes and SummaryThe purposes of the California Homegrown Food Act are to:1) Increase access to fresh, locally sourced produce for all Californians regardless of location and other socioeconomic limitations;2) Allow individuals to supplement their incomes through sale of produce grown at home or on other urban or suburban land; and3) Reduce the carbon footprint of our food system by enabling the increased cultivation of produce in or near places it is consumed.The Act will achieve these purposes by ensuring the rights of individuals and groups to cultivate and, in certain cases, sell edible plants. The Act will remove a handful of barriers arising from local zoning laws, private land covenants, and lease restrictions. \\xa0Producers must, however, still comply with any and all relevant health, agricultural, and environmental regulations. \\xa0The Act will specify the types of allowable food production practices and basis for regulation by defining three types of food growing activities and specifying reasonable limits and regulations thereof.Findings and DeclarationsThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:a) California industrial agriculture is at risk due to water shortages, soil degradation, pollution, environmental and structural threats to the San Francisco Bay Delta, and the rising cost of oil. \\xa0A food shortage from these problems is a real and imminent threat. Providing Californians with the capacity to feed themselves and their communities would drastically improve local food security and mediate the risks of \\xa0water, soil, environmental, or fuel-related crises.b) Though California is the “bread basket” of the United States and has regions of climate and land ideal for agriculture, a significant amount of California’s food is grown hundreds or thousands of miles from where it is consumed. This results in high transportation costs, energy consumption, and lost economic opportunity for our state. Even food grown in the heart of California’s farming region is expensive to disperse to the rest of the state due to rising fuel costs.c) California is no exception to rising U.S. obesity and obesity-related diseases. \\xa0It is important to note that:1. Two-thirds of American adults and nearly one-third of American children are obese or overweight, putting them at risk for developing chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, or cancer.2. One in every nine California children, one in three teens, and over half of adults are already overweight or obese. This epidemic affects virtually all Californians.3. These health conditions are preventable and curable through lifestyle choices that include consumption of healthy fresh foods.d) One of every ten dollars spent on health care in the United States goes toward treating diabetes and its complications. Facilitating opportunities for California residents to grow and consume fresh, healthy foods will promote lifestyles and diets that benefit individuals and communities, as well as more effective use of public dollars.e) Many homeowners associations have rules prohibiting homeowners from growing food in front yards or from selling food grown on the property.f) Additionally, approximately 40% of Californians are renters and may, as a result of lease restrictions or disapproval by the landlord, face limitations on their ability to grow food on the land where they reside.g) Providing Californians with increased opportunity to participate in small-scale\\xa0entrepreneurial agriculture will supplement incomes during times of high unemployment and under-employment and stimulate local economies.DefinitionsAs used in this Act, the following types of uses shall be defined as follows:Personal Agriculture:A use specific to residential zones in which individuals cultivate produce at their own residence for personal consumption or donation.Community Garden:A use in which land managed by a public entity, nonprofit organization, individual, or group of individuals is used to cultivate produce for donation or for personal consumption by those cultivating the land.EntrepreneurialAgriculture:A use in which land managed by a public entity, nonprofit organization, business entity, individual, or group of individuals is used to\\xa0cultivate produce for the purpose of sale.Produce:Raw, unprocessed fruits, vegetables, herbs, and nuts.Portion of the Bill Addressing Local Zoning LawsThe California Government Code shall be amended to require that city and county governments allow the following agricultural uses, subject to the following regulations and restrictions:Personal Agriculturea. Where Personal Agricultureshall bepermitted:Personal Agriculture shall be considered an accessory use in residential zones.b. Allowable Regulations of Personal Agriculture:Zoning regulations may not prohibit the cultivation of food plants in front or back yards for personal use. \\xa0However, cities may\\xa0make reasonable restrictions pertaining to height of plant material and the \\xa0presence of dead plant material in \\xa0front yards. \\xa0Note that cities may not restrict the use of dead plant material that is to be used as ground cover, mulch, or compost. \\xa0Cities may adopt regulations to restrict plants that could interfere with a public sidewalk.Community Gardens:a. Where Community Gardensshall bepermitted:1. \\xa0In residential zones:Community Gardens shall be a permitted use.2. In commercial zones:Community Gardens shall be a permitted use.3. In industrial zones:Community Gardens shall be a permitted use.b. Allowable Regulation of Community Gardens:Any structures for community gardening may be subject to the development standards of the zone as they apply to accessory structuresEntrepreneurialAgriculture:a. Where Entrepreneurial Agricultureshall bepermitted:1. In residential zones:Entrepreneurial Agriculture shall be a permitted use in residential zones and shall be considered an accessory use to a residence. \\xa0However, any food plant cultivation for Entrepreneurial Agriculture purposes\\xa0that occupies more than 5,000 square feet of land may be required by a city or county to obtain a conditional use permit. Entrepreneurial Agriculture\\xa0in residential areas may be subject to the following additional restrictions:A. Only mechanical equipment designed for household use may be used.B. Retail sales and all other public use of the farm shall begin no earlier than 7 a.m. and end by 7 p.m. every day of the week.C. Commercial deliveries and pickups are limited to one per day. On-site sales are not considered commercial pickups.D. \\xa0One identification sign is permitted, not exceeding 64 square inches in area.2. In commercial zones:Entrepreneurial Agriculture\\xa0shall be a permitted use.3. In industrial zones:Entrepreneurial Agriculture\\xa0shall be a permitted use.b. Regulations on Entrepreneurial Agriculture:In all zones, odor, noise, and dust caused by Entrepreneurial Agriculture\\xa0may be limited to “what a reasonable individual can tolerate” at a distance of more than 100 feet from site of the Entrepreneurial Agriculture activity.Portion of the Bill Addressing Homeowners AssociationsSection 1353.10 is added to the California Civil Code, to read:a. Notwithstanding any other law, a provision of any of the governing documents of a common interest development shall be void and unenforceable if it does any of the following:1. Prohibits, or includes conditions that have the effect of\\xa0prohibiting, the use of a Homeowner’s front or back yard, for Personal Agriculture or Entrepreneurial Agriculture.2. Prohibits, or includes conditions that have the effect of prohibiting, a Homeowner from theoff-sitesale or donation of produce grown on the Homeowner’s property.b. This section applies only to yards that are designated for the exclusive use of the Homeowner.c. This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations restrictingon-sitesale of agricultural products.e. This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations restricting the hours of operation and the number of visitors to gardens within the association.f. This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations requiring that dead plant material and weeds, with the exception of straw, mulch, and other organic materials intended to encourage vegetation and retention of moisture in the soil, are regularly cleared from the front yard.g. This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations requiring that gardens and crops do not grow more than six feet in height to preserve aesthetic appeal and cleanliness.Portion of the Bill Addressing Tenant Food CultivationApproximately40% of Californians live in residences that they do not own, which means that such tenants may have restricted rights to cultivate food, depending on what is permitted by the landlord and the lease agreement. \\xa0This Act would give tenants some rights to cultivate food, so long as such cultivation does not unreasonably interfere with existing landscaping or with common area uses by other tenants.Definitions:“Common area” refers to an area of the property that is shared with other tenants.“Private area” refers to an area of the property that is for the exclusive use of a tenant.The Act would protect the ability of tenants to cultivate and sell food, as follows:a. \\xa0A landlord shall allow a tenant to participate in Personal Agriculture or Entrepreneurial Agriculture\\xa0under the following circumstances:1.Container Plants:A tenant may cultivate food plants in containers, so long as:A. The tenant regularly removes any dead plant material and weeds.B. The placement of the containers does not interfere with any existing plants.C. The placement of the containers does not interfere with any tenant’s parking spot.D. The placement of the containers does not create a trip-and-fall hazard.E. The placement of the containers does not cause water damage to any portion of the property.F. If the containers are to be placed on top of grass, the landlord may require the tenant to re-plant grass prior to vacating the property.2.Plants in the Ground or Raised Beds:A tenant may cultivate food plants in the ground or in a raised bed, so long as:A. The tenant agrees to restore or pay for the restoration of any landscaping roughly to its original condition when the tenant vacates the property or ceases to engage in food cultivation.B. The\\xa0\\xa0tenant regularly removes any dead plant material and weeds for the food cultivation area.C. The tenant must not leave any hazards in the common area, including holes or gardening tools.3.Impact on Neighbors and Other Tenants:A tenant may not engage in gardening activities in any common areas before 7:00am or after 9:00pm; gardening activities\\xa0must not interfere with the quiet enjoyment of other residents and neighbors.\\xa0If the landlord determines, due to complaints from other residents, that the garden area is interfering with the rights of other tenants or neighbors with respect to their quiet enjoyment of the property, the landlord may terminate the tenant’s gardening rights, with 30 days written notice. The notice must explain the basis for termination of gardening rights. Such notice does not constitute a notice of termination of tenancy.4.Gardening in Common Areas:If the gardening is done in common areas, other residents must be notified in writing 15 days prior to the commencement of any food cultivation activity and given an opportunity to bring their concerns to the landlord’s attention. If more than 25% of the tenants object to the gardening activity in the common area and if their concerns are not addressed through a change in the gardening plan, then the landlord may prohibit the food cultivation activity in the common area.5.Restoration of Landscaping:With the exception of container plants on paved areas, the landlord may choose to require an additional security deposit to ensure that all landscaping may be restored after the tenant vacates the property or ceases to engage in food cultivation.6.Payment of Water and Waste Collection Bills:A landlord may require the tenant to enter into a written agreement regarding the payment of any excess water and waste collection bills stemming from the garden.7.Inspection Rights:The landlord has a right to periodically inspect the garden area to ensure compliance with the above rules.8.Off-Site Sales:The landlord may not prevent tenants from selling products derived from this gardening at an off-site location.b. Furthermore, a\\xa0landlord may prohibit a tenant from engaging in Entrepreneurial Agriculture, unless the tenant demonstrates that the Entrepreneurial Agriculture operations maintain in force either liability insurance covering injury to clients and guests in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars\\xa0($100,000) per occurrence and three hundred thousand dollars\\xa0($300,000) in the total annual aggregate, sustained on account of the\\xa0negligence of the licensee or its employees, or a bond in the aggregate amount of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000).ShareEmailPrintFacebookLinkedInTumblrTwitterPinterestRedditDiggPocketGoogleStumbleUponGarden Manager Roles & Responsibilities The Garden Leadership Team consists of garden members who take on volunteer positions aimed atsupporting the day to day operations of the garden.

Some want to sa ve \\nmoney on their food bills.  Others like the freshness, flavor an d wholesomeness of home-grown produce.  And for many, gardening  is \\na relaxing way to exercise and enjoy being out-of-doors.  There are also families from other cultures who would like to grow \\ntraditional foods not available in the supermarket.  \\n Community gardens beautify neighborhoods and help bring neighbors closer together.  They have been proven as tools to reduce neighborhood crime--particularly when vacant, blighted lots are targeted for garden development.  Community gardens provide saf e, \\nrecreational green space in urban areas with little or no park land, and can contribute greatly  to keeping urban air clean. \\n \\n Those who are lucky enough to have sunny backyards or balconies can plant a garden whenever they  have the time and energy.  \\nBut what about those who do not have a place to garden?  For these people, community gardens may be the answer. \\n \\nStep by Step To Your Own Community Garden  \\n1. Get Your Neighbors Involved  \\nThere is a lot of work involved in starting a new garden.  Make  sure you have several people who will help you.  Over the years , our \\nexperience indicates that there should be at least ten interested families to cr eate and sustain a garden project.  Survey the residents of \\nyour neighborhood to see if they are interested and would participate.  Hold monthly meetings of the interested group to develo p and \\ninitiate plans, keep people posted on the garden's progress, and keep them involved in the process from day one.  \\n2. Form a Garden Club  \\nA garden club is a way of formally organizing your new group.  It helps you make decisions and divide-up the work effectively.  It \\nalso ensures that every one has a vested interest in the garden and can contribute to its design, development, and maintenance.   It can \\nbe formed at any time during the process of  starting a community garden; however, it's wi se to do so early on.  This way, club \\nmembers can share in the many tasks of establishing the new gard en.  The typical garden club will have many functions, includin g: \\n• Establishing garden rules (see sample) \\n• Accepting and reviewing garden applications \\n• Making plot assignments \\n• Collecting garden dues (if any) \\n• Paying water bills \\n• Resolving conflicts \\nThe typical garden club has at least two officers:  a president and a treasurer; although your garden club may have more if nec essary.  \\nElections for garden officers usually are held annually.   \\n \\n 2\\nFind Land for the Garden \\n \\nLook around your neighbor hood for a vacant lo t that gets plenty of sun--at least six to  eight hours each day.  A garden site sh ould be \\nrelatively flat (although slight slopes ca n be terraced).  It should be relatively fr ee of large pieces of concrete left behind  from \\ndemolition of structures.  Any rubble or debris should be manageable--that is, it can be removed by volunteers clearing the lot  with \\ntrash bags, wheelbarrows, and pick up trucks.  Ideally, it should have a fence around it with a gate wide enough for a vehicle to \\nenter.  It is possible to work with a site that is paved with  concrete or asphalt by building raised beds that sit on the surfa ce or using \\ncontainers.  You can also remove the asphalt or concrete to cr eate areas for gardens, but such a garden will be much more diffi cult, \\nexpensive, and time-consuming to start.  A site without pa ving, and soil relatively free of trash and debris is best. \\n \\nThe potential garden site should be within walking, or no more  than a short drive from you and the neighbors who have expressed  \\ninterest in participating.  If the lot is not already being used , make sure the community supports establishing a garden there.  \\n \\nIt's best to select three potential sites in your neighborhood and write down their address and ne arest cross streets.  If you don't know \\nthe address of a vacant lot, get the addresses of the properti es on both sides of the lot--this will give you the ability to ma ke an \\neducated guess on the address of the site.  We suggest you identify at least three potential sites b ecause one or more might no t be \\navailable for you to use for various reasons, and you want to end up with at least one that works out. \\n \\n3. Find out Who Owns the Land \\n \\nIt is illegal to use land without obtaining the owners permission.  In order to obtain permission, you must first find out who owns the \\nland. \\n \\nTake the information you have written down about the location of th e sites in step 3 to your county's tax assessor's office.  T he Los \\nAngeles County Tax Assessor's office is located at 225 North Hill Street, Room 205.  Or go to a branch office listed in the whi te \\npages of the telephone directory.  At this office, you will look  through the map books to get the names and addresses of the ow ner of \\nthe sites you are interested in. \\n \\n4. Find out if Your Proposed Site has Water \\n \\nWhile you are researching site ownership, contact the water servi ce provider in your area to fi nd out if your potential site(s)  \\nhas/have an existing water meter to hook-in to.  Call your water provider's customer service department, and ask them to conduc t a \\nsite investigation.  They will need the same location inform ation that you took with you to the Tax Asse ssor's office. \\n \\nExisting access to water will make a critical difference in the expense of getting your project started.  Depending on the size  of your \\ngarden site, you will need a 1/2-inch to 1-inch water meter.  If there has been water service to the site in the past, it is re latively \\ninexpensive to get a new water meter installed (if one doesn't al ready exist).  If there has never been water service to that s ite, it \\nmight cost much more for your water provider to install a lateral line from the street main to the site and install your new me ter. \\n \\n5 Contact the Land Owner \\n \\nOnce you have determined that your potential site is feasible, write a letter to the landowner asking for permission to use the  \\nproperty for a community garden.  Be sure to mention to the landowner the value of the garden to the community and the fact the  \\ngardeners will be responsible for keeping the site clean and weed -free (this saves landowners from maintaining the site or payi ng \\ncity weed abatement fees).  \\nEstablish a term for use of the site, and prepare and negotiate a lease.  Typically, groups lease garden sites from land owners  for $1 \\nper year.  You should attempt to negotiate a lease for a least thr ee years (or longer if the proper ty owner is agreeable).  Man y \\nlandowners are worried about their liability for injuries that mi ght occur at the garden.  Therefore, you should include a simp le hold \\nharmless waiver in the lease and in gardener agreement forms.  For more information on the lease, and the hold harmless waiver , \\nsee 8, Signing a Lease.  \\nBe prepared to purchase liability insuran ce to protect further the property owner (and  yourself) should an accident occur at th e \\ngarden.  For more information on the hold harmless waiver, and liability insurance, see 8, Signing a Lease, and 9, Obtaining  \\nLiability Insurance. \\n \\n6. Get Your Soil Tested \\n \\nIt might be advisable to have the soil at the site tested for fertility pH and presence of hea vy metals.  Contact a private lab . \\n \\n7. Signing a Lease \\n \\nLandowners of potential garden sites might be concerned abou t their liability should someone be injured while working in the \\ngarden.  Your group should be prepared to offer the landowner a lease with a hold harmless waiver.  This hold harmless waiv er \\ncan simply state that should one of the ga rdeners be injured as a result of negligence  on the part of another gardener, the lan downer \\nis held harmless and will not be sued.  Each gardener should be made aware of this waiver and sh ould be required to sign an \\n 3\\nagreement in order to obtain a plot in the community garden.  A sample gardener agreement form is attached which your \\ngroup can use as a model.  \\n8. Obtaining Liability Insurance \\n \\nLandowners may also require that your group purchase liabilit y insurance.  Community gardeners in the Los Angeles area can \\nobtain inexpensive policies from Metro Farm Gardens.  Contact Toby Leaman at (323) 663-7441 or fax (323) 663-5715, for more \\ninformation on obtaining an insurance policy.  \\nOnce you have a lease signed by the landowner and liability insurance, you're free to plan and plant your garden!  \\n9. Planning the Garden \\n \\nCommunity members should be involved in the planning, design, and set-up of the garden.  Before the design process begins, you \\nshould measure your site and make a simple, to-scale site map.  Hold two or three garden design meetings at times when interest ed \\nparticipants can attend.  Make sure that group decisions are re corded in official minutes, or that someone takes accurate notes .  This \\nensures that decisions made can be communicated to others, and progress will not be slowed.  A great way to generate ideas and \\nvisualize the design is to use simple drawings or photos cut from garden magazines representing the different garden components --\\nflower beds, compost bins, pathways, arbors, etc.--that can be moved around on the map as the group discusses layout.  \\na. Basic Elements of a Community Garden \\n \\nAlthough there are exceptions to every rule, co mmunity gardens should almost always include: \\n \\n• At least 15 plots assigned to community members.  These should be placed in the sunniest part of the garden.  Without plots f or \\nindividual participation, it is very difficult to achieve long-te rm community involvement.  Raised bed plots, which are more \\nexpensive, should be no more than 4 feet wide (to facilitate access to plants from the sides w ithout stepping into the bed), an d \\nbetween 8 and 12 feet long (it is advisable to construct your ra ised beds in sizes that are found in readily-available lumber, or that \\ncan be cut without too much waste).  In-ground plots can be from 10 x 10 up to 20 x 20 feet.  Pathways between beds and plots \\nshould be least 3 to 4 feet wide to allow space for wheelbarrows.  The soil in both raised bed and in-ground plots should be \\namended with aged compost or manure to improve its fertility and increase its organic matter content. \\n \\n• A simple irrigation system with one hose bib or faucet for every four plots.  Hand watering with a hose is the most practical  and \\naffordable for individual plots (and it's al most a necessity when you start plants from  seed).  Drip and soaker-hose irrigation  can be \\nused in all areas of the garden for transplanted and establishe d plants, but especially for deep -rooted fruit trees and ornamen tals.  If \\nno one in your group is knowledgeable about irrigation, you might need some assistance in designing your irrigation system.  Se ek \\nout a landscape contractor or nursery or garden center professional to help you develop a basic layout and materials list. \\n \\n• An 8-foot fence around the perimeter with a drive-through gate .  In our experience, this is a key element of success.  Don't \\ncount on eliminating all acts of vandalism or theft, but fencing will help to keep these to tolerably low levels.  \\n• A tool shed or other structure for storing tools, supplies, and materials.  Recycled metal shipping containers make excellent  \\nstorage sheds, and are almost vandal-proof.  Contact the Port Authority for leads on where to find them. \\n \\n• A bench or picnic table where gardeners can sit, relax, and take  a break--preferably in shade.  If there are no shade trees o n the \\nsite, a simple arbor can be constructed from wood or pipe, and planted with chayote squash, bougainvillea, grapes, kiwis, or so me \\nother vine.  \\n• A sign with the garden's name, sponsors, and a contact person's phone number for more information.  If your community is bilingual, include information in this language. \\n \\n• A shared composting area for the community  gardeners.  Wood pallets are easy to come-by and (when stood on-end, attached \\nin a U-shape, and the inside covered with galvanized rabbit-wire) make excellent compost bins.  \\nb. Nice Additions to Your Garden Plan \\n \\n• A small fruit tree orchard, whose care and harvest can be shared  by all the members.  The or chard can also create shade for \\npeople as well as shade-loving plants. \\n \\n• A water fountain.  This can be a simple drinking fountain attachment to a hose bib (or faucet) you can purchase at a hardware  \\nstore.  \\n• Perimeter landscaping, which can focus on drought tolerant  flowers and shrubs, plants which attract butterflies and \\nhummingbirds, or roses and other flowers suitable for cutting bou quets.  Herbs are also well-suited to perimeter landscaping an d \\nhelp to create barriers to unwanted pest insects who do not like the smell of their essential oils. \\n \\n• A children's area, which can include special small pl ots for children, a sand box, and play equipment. \\n \\n• A meeting area, which could range from a semi-circle of hay ba les or tree stumps, to a simple amphitheater built of recycled,  \\nbroken concrete.  Building a shade struct ure above would be beneficial as well. \\n 4\\n \\n• A community bulletin board where rules, meeting notices, and other important information can be posted. \\n \\n10. Creating a Garden Budget  \\nUse your design to develop a materials list and cost-out the pr oject.  You will need to call-around to get prices on fencing an d other \\nitems.  You might be surprised at the cost.  A community garden with just the Basic Elements (listed above) typically costs bet ween \\n$2,500 to $5,000.  At this point, your group might decide to scale back your initial plans and save some design ideas for a Ph ase \\nTwo of the garden. \\n \\n11. Where to Get Materials and Money  \\nWhile some start-up funds will be needed through determination and hard work, you can obtain donations of materials for your project.  Community businesses might assist, and provide anything from fencing to lumber to plants.  The important thing is to ask.  \\nDevelop a letter that tells merchants about your project and why it's important to the community.  Attach your wish list, but  be \\nreasonable.  Try to personalize this letter for each business you approach.  Drop it off personally with the store manager, pre ferably \\nwith a couple of cute kids who will be gard ening in tow!  Then, follow-up by phone.  Be patient, persistent, and polite.  Your efforts \\nwill pay-off with at least some of the businesses you approach.  Be sure to thank these key supporters and recognize them on yo ur \\ngarden sign, at a garden grand opening, or other special event. \\n \\nMoney, which will be needed to purchase items not donated, can be  obtained through community fund-raisers such as car washes, \\ncraft and rummage sales, pancake breakfasts, and bake sales.  They can also be  obtained by writing grants, but be aware grant \\nwriting efforts can take six months or longer to yield results, an d you must have a fiscal sponsor or agent with tax-exempt 501 (c)3 \\nstatus (such as a church or non-profit corporation) that agrees to administer the funds. \\n \\n12. Make Sure Your Garden Infrastructure is in Place  \\nIf you have not yet formed a garden club, now is the time to do so.  It's also time to establish garden rules, develop a garden  \\napplication form for those who wish to participate, set up a bank account, and determine what garden dues will be if these thin gs \\nhave not already been done.  This is also the time to begin having monthly meetings if you have not already done so.  Also, if you \\nhaven't already contacted your city councilperson, he or she can be helpful in many ways including helping your group obtain ci ty \\nservices such as trash pick-up.  Their staff can also help you with community organizing and soliciting for material donations.  \\n \\n13.   Get Growing!  \\nMany new garden groups make the mistake of remaining in the planning, design and fundraising stage for an extended period of \\ntime.  There is a fine line between planning well and over plan ning.  After several months of the initial research, designing, \\nplanning, and outreach efforts, group members will very like ly be feeling frustrated and will begin to wonder if all their effo rts will \\never result in a garden.  That's why it's important to plant something on your site as soon as possible.  People need to see vi sible \\nresults or they will begin to lose interest in the project.  To keep the momentum going, initiate the following steps even if y ou are \\nstill seeking donations and funds or your project (but not until you have signed a lease and obtained insurance).  \\na. Clean up the Site \\nSchedule community workdays to clean up the site.  How many work days you need will depend on the size of the site, and how \\nmuch and what kind of debris are on site.   \\n \\nb. Install the Irrigation System \\nWithout water, you can't grow anything.  So get this key element into place as soon as possible.  There are plenty of opportuni ties \\nfor community involvement--from digging trenches to laying out PVC pipes. \\n \\nc. Plant Something \\nOnce you have water, there are many options for in-garden action.  Stake out beds and pathways by marking them with stakes and \\ntwine.  Mulch pathways.  If your fence is n't in yet, some people might still want to accept the risk of vandalism and get their  plots \\nstarted.  You can also plant shade and fruit trees and begin to landscape the site.  If you do not yet have a source of donated  plants, \\nor don't wish to risk having them vandalized, plant annual flower  seeds which will grow quickly and can be replaced later.  See ds \\nfor Los Angeles County community and school gardens can be obtained through the Common Ground Garden Program (323) 260-\\n3348.  \\nd. Continue to construct the garden as  materials and funds become available. \\n \\n14. Celebrate!  \\nAt this point, your ideas and hard work have finally become a community garden!  Be sure to take time to celebrate.  Have a gra nd \\nopening, barbecue, or some other fun event to give everyone who helped to make this happen, a special thank-you.  This is the t ime \\nto give all those who gave donated materials or time a sp ecial certificate, bouquet, or other form of recognition. \\n \\n15. Troubleshooting as the Garden Develops  \\n 5\\nAll community gardens will experience problems somewhere along  the way.  Don't get discourage--get organized.  The key \\nto success for community gardens is not only preventing problems from ever occurring, but also working together to solve them \\nwhen they do inevitably occur.  In our experience, these are some of the most common problems that crop-up in community \\ngardens, and our suggestions for solving them  \\na. Vandalism \\nMost gardens experience occasional vandalism.  The best action you can take is to replant immediately.  Generally the vandals \\nbecome bored after a while and st op.  Good community outr each, especially to youth and the ga rden's immediately neighbors is al so \\nimportant.  Most important--don't get to discouraged.  It happens.  Get over it and keep going.  What about barbed wired or raz or \\nwire to make the garden more secure?  Our advice--don't.  It's  bad for community relations, looks awful, and is sometimes illeg al to \\ninstall without a permit.  If you need more physical deterrents to keep vandals out, plant bougainvillea or pyracantha along yo ur \\nfence, their thorns will do the trick!  \\nb. Security \\nInvite the community officer from your local precinct to a garden meeting to get their suggestions on making the garden more \\nsecure.  Community officers can also be a great help in solving problems with garden vandalism, and dealing with drug dealers, and \\ngang members in the area.  \\nc. Communication \\nClear and well-enforced garden rules and a strong garden president can go a long way towards minimizing misunderstandings in th e \\ngarden.  But communication problems do arise.  It's the job of the garden club to resolve those issues.  If it's something not clearly \\nspelled out in the rules, the membership can take a vote to add new rules and make modifications to existing rules.  \\nLanguage barriers are a very common source of misunderstandings.  Garden club leadership should make every effort to have a \\ntranslator at garden meetings where partic ipants are bilingual--perhaps a family member  of one of the garden members who speaks  \\nthe language will offer to help.  \\nd. Trash \\nIt's important to get your compost system going right away and get some training for gardeners on how to use it.  If gardeners don't \\ncompost, large quantities of waste will begin to build up, create an eyesore, and could hurt your  relationships with neighbors and the \\nproperty owner.  Waste can also become a fire hazard.  Make su re gardeners know how to sort trash properly, what to compost, an d \\nwhat to recycle.  Trash cans placed in accessible areas are helpful to keep  a neat and tidy garden. \\n \\ne. Gardener Drop-Out \\nThere has been, and probably always will be, a high rate of turn over in community gardens.  Often, people sign up for plots and  \\nthen don't follow through.  Remember, gardening is hard work for so me people, especially in the heat  of summer.  Be sure to hav e a \\nclause in your gardener agreement which stat es gardeners forfeit their right to their plot if they don't plant it within one mo nth, or if \\nthey don't maintain it.  While gardeners should be given ever y opportunity to follow through, if after several reminders either  by \\nletter or phone nothing changes, it is time for the club to reassi gn the plot.  It is also advi sable that every year, the leade rship \\nconduct a renewed community outreach campaig n by contacting churches and other groups in the neighborhood to let them know \\nabout the garden and that  plots are available.  \\nf. Weeds \\nGardeners tend to visit their plots less during the winter time, and lower participation, combined with rain, tends to create a  huge \\nweed problem in January, February, and March.   Remember, part of your agreement with  the landowner is that you will maintain \\nthe lot and keep weeds from taking over.  In the late summer/ear ly fall, provide gardeners with a workshop or printed material about \\nwhat can be grown in a fall and winter garden.  Also, schedule garden workdays for the spring in advance since you know you'll \\nneed them at the end of winter to clear weeds.  If you anticip ate that plots will be untended during the winter, apply a thick layer of \\nmulch or hay to the beds and paths to reduce weed proliferation.  \\nGood luck with your community garden project!   \\nYvonne Savio, Common Ground Garden Program Manager, University of California Cooperative Extension, Los Angeles County \\n4800 E.

      "About the California Homegrown Food ActThe Sustainable Economies Law Center will soon seek a California legislator to author a bill in 2013 to reduce legal barriers to the cultivation and sale of homegrown and locallygrown produce We have posted a summary of the bill here in order to seek feedback  Please post a comment letting us know your thoughts on the proposal below or email JanelleSELC at gmailcom with your questions and comments Thank youPurposes and SummaryThe purposes of the California Homegrown Food Act are to1 Increase access to fresh locally sourced produce for all Californians regardless of location and other socioeconomic limitations2 Allow individuals to supplement their incomes through sale of produce grown at home or on other urban or suburban land and3 Reduce the carbon footprint of our food system by enabling the increased cultivation of produce in or near places it is consumedThe Act will achieve these purposes by ensuring the rights of individuals and groups to cultivate and in certain cases sell edible plants The Act will remove a handful of barriers arising from local zoning laws private land covenants and lease restrictions  Producers must however still comply with any and all relevant health agricultural and environmental regulations  The Act will specify the types of allowable food production practices and basis for regulation by defining three types of food growing activities and specifying reasonable limits and regulations thereofFindings and DeclarationsThe Legislature finds and declares all of the followinga California industrial agriculture is at risk due to water shortages soil degradation pollution environmental and structural threats to the San Francisco Bay Delta and the rising cost of oil  A food shortage from these problems is a real and imminent threat Providing Californians with the capacity to feed themselves and their communities would drastically improve local food security and mediate the risks of  water soil environmental or fuelrelated crisesb Though California is the bread basket of the United States and has regions of climate and land ideal for agriculture a significant amount of Californias food is grown hundreds or thousands of miles from where it is consumed This results in high transportation costs energy consumption and lost economic opportunity for our state Even food grown in the heart of Californias farming region is expensive to disperse to the rest of the state due to rising fuel costsc California is no exception to rising US obesity and obesityrelated diseases  It is important to note that1 Twothirds of American adults and nearly onethird of American children are obese or overweight putting them at risk for developing chronic diseases such as diabetes heart disease or cancer2 One in every nine California children one in three teens and over half of adults are already overweight or obese This epidemic affects virtually all Californians3 These health conditions are preventable and curable through lifestyle choices that include consumption of healthy fresh foodsd One of every ten dollars spent on health care in the United States goes toward treating diabetes and its complications Facilitating opportunities for California residents to grow and consume fresh healthy foods will promote lifestyles and diets that benefit individuals and communities as well as more effective use of public dollarse Many homeowners associations have rules prohibiting homeowners from growing food in front yards or from selling food grown on the propertyf Additionally approximately 40 of Californians are renters and may as a result of lease restrictions or disapproval by the landlord face limitations on their ability to grow food on the land where they resideg Providing Californians with increased opportunity to participate in smallscale entrepreneurial agriculture will supplement incomes during times of high unemployment and underemployment and stimulate local economiesDefinitionsAs used in this Act the following types of uses shall be defined as followsPersonal AgricultureA use specific to residential zones in which individuals cultivate produce at their own residence for personal consumption or donationCommunity GardenA use in which land managed by a public entity nonprofit organization individual or group of individuals is used to cultivate produce for donation or for personal consumption by those cultivating the landEntrepreneurialAgricultureA use in which land managed by a public entity nonprofit organization business entity individual or group of individuals is used to cultivate produce for the purpose of saleProduceRaw unprocessed fruits vegetables herbs and nutsPortion of the Bill Addressing Local Zoning LawsThe California Government Code shall be amended to require that city and county governments allow the following agricultural uses subject to the following regulations and restrictionsPersonal Agriculturea Where Personal Agricultureshall bepermittedPersonal Agriculture shall be considered an accessory use in residential zonesb Allowable Regulations of Personal AgricultureZoning regulations may not prohibit the cultivation of food plants in front or back yards for personal use  However cities may make reasonable restrictions pertaining to height of plant material and the  presence of dead plant material in  front yards  Note that cities may not restrict the use of dead plant material that is to be used as ground cover mulch or compost  Cities may adopt regulations to restrict plants that could interfere with a public sidewalkCommunity Gardensa Where Community Gardensshall bepermitted1  In residential zonesCommunity Gardens shall be a permitted use2 In commercial zonesCommunity Gardens shall be a permitted use3 In industrial zonesCommunity Gardens shall be a permitted useb Allowable Regulation of Community GardensAny structures for community gardening may be subject to the development standards of the zone as they apply to accessory structuresEntrepreneurialAgriculturea Where Entrepreneurial Agricultureshall bepermitted1 In residential zonesEntrepreneurial Agriculture shall be a permitted use in residential zones and shall be considered an accessory use to a residence  However any food plant cultivation for Entrepreneurial Agriculture purposes that occupies more than 5000 square feet of land may be required by a city or county to obtain a conditional use permit Entrepreneurial Agriculture in residential areas may be subject to the following additional restrictionsA Only mechanical equipment designed for household use may be usedB Retail sales and all other public use of the farm shall begin no earlier than 7 am and end by 7 pm every day of the weekC Commercial deliveries and pickups are limited to one per day Onsite sales are not considered commercial pickupsD  One identification sign is permitted not exceeding 64 square inches in area2 In commercial zonesEntrepreneurial Agriculture shall be a permitted use3 In industrial zonesEntrepreneurial Agriculture shall be a permitted useb Regulations on Entrepreneurial AgricultureIn all zones odor noise and dust caused by Entrepreneurial Agriculture may be limited to what a reasonable individual can tolerate at a distance of more than 100 feet from site of the Entrepreneurial Agriculture activityPortion of the Bill Addressing Homeowners AssociationsSection 135310 is added to the California Civil Code to reada Notwithstanding any other law a provision of any of the governing documents of a common interest development shall be void and unenforceable if it does any of the following1 Prohibits or includes conditions that have the effect of prohibiting the use of a Homeowners front or back yard for Personal Agriculture or Entrepreneurial Agriculture2 Prohibits or includes conditions that have the effect of prohibiting a Homeowner from theoffsitesale or donation of produce grown on the Homeowners propertyb This section applies only to yards that are designated for the exclusive use of the Homeownerc This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations restrictingonsitesale of agricultural productse This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations restricting the hours of operation and the number of visitors to gardens within the associationf This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations requiring that dead plant material and weeds with the exception of straw mulch and other organic materials intended to encourage vegetation and retention of moisture in the soil are regularly cleared from the front yardg This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations requiring that gardens and crops do not grow more than six feet in height to preserve aesthetic appeal and cleanlinessPortion of the Bill Addressing Tenant Food CultivationApproximately40 of Californians live in residences that they do not own which means that such tenants may have restricted rights to cultivate food depending on what is permitted by the landlord and the lease agreement  This Act would give tenants some rights to cultivate food so long as such cultivation does not unreasonably interfere with existing landscaping or with common area uses by other tenantsDefinitionsCommon area refers to an area of the property that is shared with other tenantsPrivate area refers to an area of the property that is for the exclusive use of a tenantThe Act would protect the ability of tenants to cultivate and sell food as followsa  A landlord shall allow a tenant to participate in Personal Agriculture or Entrepreneurial Agriculture under the following circumstances1Container PlantsA tenant may cultivate food plants in containers so long asA The tenant regularly removes any dead plant material and weedsB The placement of the containers does not interfere with any existing plantsC The placement of the containers does not interfere with any tenants parking spotD The placement of the containers does not create a tripandfall hazardE The placement of the containers does not cause water damage to any portion of the propertyF If the containers are to be placed on top of grass the landlord may require the tenant to replant grass prior to vacating the property2Plants in the Ground or Raised BedsA tenant may cultivate food plants in the ground or in a raised bed so long asA The tenant agrees to restore or pay for the restoration of any landscaping roughly to its original condition when the tenant vacates the property or ceases to engage in food cultivationB The  tenant regularly removes any dead plant material and weeds for the food cultivation areaC The tenant must not leave any hazards in the common area including holes or gardening tools3Impact on Neighbors and Other TenantsA tenant may not engage in gardening activities in any common areas before 700am or after 900pm gardening activities must not interfere with the quiet enjoyment of other residents and neighbors If the landlord determines due to complaints from other residents that the garden area is interfering with the rights of other tenants or neighbors with respect to their quiet enjoyment of the property the landlord may terminate the tenants gardening rights with 30 days written notice The notice must explain the basis for termination of gardening rights Such notice does not constitute a notice of termination of tenancy4Gardening in Common AreasIf the gardening is done in common areas other residents must be notified in writing 15 days prior to the commencement of any food cultivation activity and given an opportunity to bring their concerns to the landlords attention If more than 25 of the tenants object to the gardening activity in the common area and if their concerns are not addressed through a change in the gardening plan then the landlord may prohibit the food cultivation activity in the common area5Restoration of LandscapingWith the exception of container plants on paved areas the landlord may choose to require an additional security deposit to ensure that all landscaping may be restored after the tenant vacates the property or ceases to engage in food cultivation6Payment of Water and Waste Collection BillsA landlord may require the tenant to enter into a written agreement regarding the payment of any excess water and waste collection bills stemming from the garden7Inspection RightsThe landlord has a right to periodically inspect the garden area to ensure compliance with the above rules8OffSite SalesThe landlord may not prevent tenants from selling products derived from this gardening at an offsite locationb Furthermore a landlord may prohibit a tenant from engaging in Entrepreneurial Agriculture unless the tenant demonstrates that the Entrepreneurial Agriculture operations maintain in force either liability insurance covering injury to clients and guests in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars 100000 per occurrence and three hundred thousand dollars 300000 in the total annual

individuals and groups to cultivate and in certain cases sell edible plants The Act will remove a handful of barriers arising from local zoning laws private land covenants and lease restrictions  Producers must however still comply with any and all relevant health agricultural and environmental regulations  The Act will specify the types of allowable food production practices and basis for regulation by defining three types of food growing activities and specifying reasonable limits and regulations thereofFindings and DeclarationsThe Legislature finds and declares all of the followinga California industrial agriculture is at risk due to water shortages soil degradation pollution environmental and structural threats to the San Francisco Bay Delta and the rising cost of oil  A food shortage from these problems is a real and imminent threat Providing Californians with the capacity to feed themselves and their communities would drastically improve local food security and mediate the risks of  water soil environmental or fuelrelated crisesb Though California is the bread basket of the United States and has regions of climate and land ideal for agriculture a significant amount of Californias food is grown hundreds or thousands of miles from where it is consumed This results in high transportation costs energy consumption and lost economic opportunity for our state Even food grown in the heart of Californias farming region is expensive to disperse to the rest of the state due to rising fuel costsc California is no exception to rising US obesity and obesityrelated diseases  It is important to note that1 Twothirds of American adults and nearly onethird of American children are obese or overweight putting them at risk for developing chronic diseases such as diabetes heart disease or cancer2 One in every nine California children one in three teens and over half of adults are already overweight or obese This epidemic affects virtually all Californians3 These health conditions are preventable and curable through lifestyle choices that include consumption of healthy fresh foodsd One of every ten dollars spent on health care in the United States goes toward treating diabetes and its complications Facilitating opportunities for California residents to grow and consume fresh healthy foods will promote lifestyles and diets that benefit individuals and communities as well as more effective use of public dollarse Many homeowners associations have rules prohibiting homeowners from growing food in front yards or from selling food grown on the propertyf Additionally approximately 40 of Californians are renters and may as a result of lease restrictions or disapproval by the landlord face limitations on their ability to grow food on the land where they resideg Providing Californians with increased opportunity to participate in smallscale entrepreneurial agriculture will supplement incomes during times of high unemployment and underemployment and stimulate local economiesDefinitionsAs used in this Act the following types of uses shall be defined as followsPersonal AgricultureA use specific to residential zones in which individuals cultivate

CultivationApproximately40 of Californians live in residences that they do not own which means that such tenants may have restricted rights to cultivate food depending on what is permitted by the landlord and the lease agreement  This Act would give tenants some rights to cultivate food so long as such cultivation does not unreasonably interfere with existing landscaping or with common area uses by other tenantsDefinitionsCommon area refers to an area of the property that is shared with other tenantsPrivate area refers to an area of the property that is for the exclusive use of a tenantThe Act would protect the ability of tenants to cultivate and sell food as followsa  A landlord shall allow a tenant to participate in Personal Agriculture or Entrepreneurial Agriculture under

rights with 30 days written notice The notice must explain the basis for termination of gardening rights Such notice does not constitute a notice of termination of tenancy4Gardening in Common AreasIf the gardening is done in common areas other residents must be notified in writing 15 days prior to the commencement of any food cultivation activity and given an opportunity to bring their concerns to the landlords attention If more than 25 of the tenants object to the gardening activity in the common area and if their concerns are not addressed through a change in the gardening plan then the

      "About the California Homegrown Food ActThe Sustainable Economies Law Center will soon seek a California legislator to author a bill in 2013 to reduce legal barriers to the cultivation and sale of homegrown and locallygrown produce We have posted a summary of the bill here in order to seek feedback  Please post a comment letting us know your thoughts on the proposal below or email JanelleSELC at gmailcom with your questions and comments Thank youPurposes and SummaryThe purposes of the California Homegrown Food Act are to1 Increase access to fresh locally sourced produce for all Californians regardless of location and other socioeconomic limitations2 Allow individuals to supplement their incomes through sale of produce grown at home or on other urban or suburban land and3 Reduce the carbon footprint of our food system by enabling the increased cultivation of produce in or near places it is consumedThe Act will achieve these purposes by ensuring the rights of individuals and groups to cultivate and in certain cases sell edible plants The Act will remove a handful of barriers arising from local zoning laws private land covenants and lease restrictions  Producers must however still comply with any and all relevant health agricultural and environmental regulations  The Act will specify the types of allowable food production practices and basis for regulation by defining three types of food growing activities and specifying reasonable limits and regulations thereofFindings and DeclarationsThe Legislature finds and declares all of the followinga California industrial agriculture is at risk due to water shortages soil degradation pollution environmental and structural threats to the San Francisco Bay Delta and the rising cost of oil  A food shortage from these problems is a real and imminent threat Providing Californians with the capacity to feed themselves and their communities would drastically improve local food security and mediate the risks of  water soil environmental or fuelrelated crisesb Though California is the bread basket of the United States and has regions of climate and land ideal for agriculture a significant amount of Californias food is grown hundreds or thousands of miles from where it is consumed This results in high transportation costs energy consumption and lost economic opportunity for our state Even food grown in the heart of Californias farming region is expensive to disperse to the rest of the state due to rising fuel costsc California is no exception to rising US obesity and obesityrelated diseases  It is important to note that1 Twothirds of American adults and nearly onethird of American children are obese or overweight putting them at risk for developing chronic diseases such as diabetes heart disease or cancer2 One in every nine California children one in three teens and over half of adults are already overweight or obese This epidemic affects virtually all Californians3 These health conditions are preventable and curable through lifestyle choices that include consumption of healthy fresh foodsd One of every ten dollars spent on health care in the United States goes toward treating diabetes and its complications Facilitating opportunities for California residents to grow and consume fresh healthy foods will promote lifestyles and diets that benefit individuals and communities as well as more effective use of public dollarse Many homeowners associations have rules prohibiting homeowners from growing food in front yards or from selling food grown on the propertyf Additionally approximately 40 of Californians are renters and may as a result of lease restrictions or disapproval by the landlord face limitations on their ability to grow food on the land where they resideg Providing Californians with increased opportunity to participate in smallscale entrepreneurial agriculture will supplement incomes during times of high unemployment and underemployment and stimulate local economiesDefinitionsAs used in this Act the following types of uses shall be defined as followsPersonal AgricultureA use specific to residential zones in which individuals cultivate produce at their own residence for personal consumption or donationCommunity GardenA use in which land managed by a public entity nonprofit organization individual or group of individuals is used to cultivate produce for donation or for personal consumption by those cultivating the landEntrepreneurialAgricultureA use in which land managed by a public entity nonprofit organization business entity individual or group of individuals is used to cultivate produce for the purpose of saleProduceRaw unprocessed fruits vegetables herbs and nutsPortion of the Bill Addressing Local Zoning LawsThe California Government Code shall be amended to require that city and county governments allow the following agricultural uses subject to the following regulations and restrictionsPersonal Agriculturea Where Personal Agricultureshall bepermittedPersonal Agriculture shall be considered an accessory use in residential zonesb Allowable Regulations of Personal AgricultureZoning regulations may not prohibit the cultivation of food plants in front or back yards for personal use  However cities may make reasonable restrictions pertaining to height of plant material and the  presence of dead plant material in  front yards  Note that cities may not restrict the use of dead plant material that is to be used as ground cover mulch or compost  Cities may adopt regulations to restrict plants that could interfere with a public sidewalkCommunity Gardensa Where Community Gardensshall bepermitted1  In residential zonesCommunity Gardens shall be a permitted use2 In commercial zonesCommunity Gardens shall be a permitted use3 In industrial zonesCommunity Gardens shall be a permitted useb Allowable Regulation of Community GardensAny structures for community gardening may be subject to the development standards of the zone as they apply to accessory structuresEntrepreneurialAgriculturea Where Entrepreneurial Agricultureshall bepermitted1 In residential zonesEntrepreneurial Agriculture shall be a permitted use in residential zones and shall be considered an accessory use to a residence  However any food plant cultivation for Entrepreneurial Agriculture purposes that occupies more than 5000 square feet of land may be required by a city or county to obtain a conditional use permit Entrepreneurial Agriculture in residential areas may be subject to the following additional restrictionsA Only mechanical equipment designed for household use may be usedB Retail sales and all other public use of the farm shall begin no earlier than 7 am and end by 7 pm every day of the weekC Commercial deliveries and pickups are limited to one per day Onsite sales are not considered commercial pickupsD  One identification sign is permitted not exceeding 64 square inches in area2 In commercial zonesEntrepreneurial Agriculture shall be a permitted use3 In industrial zonesEntrepreneurial Agriculture shall be a permitted useb Regulations on Entrepreneurial AgricultureIn all zones odor noise and dust caused by Entrepreneurial Agriculture may be limited to what a reasonable individual can tolerate at a distance of more than 100 feet from site of the Entrepreneurial Agriculture activityPortion of the Bill Addressing Homeowners AssociationsSection 135310 is added to the California Civil Code to reada Notwithstanding any other law a provision of any of the governing documents of a common interest development shall be void and unenforceable if it does any of the following1 Prohibits or includes conditions that have the effect of prohibiting the use of a Homeowners front or back yard for Personal Agriculture or Entrepreneurial Agriculture2 Prohibits or includes conditions that have the effect of prohibiting a Homeowner from theoffsitesale or donation of produce grown on the Homeowners propertyb This section applies only to yards that are designated for the exclusive use of the Homeownerc This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations restrictingonsitesale of agricultural productse This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations restricting the hours of operation and the number of visitors to gardens within the associationf This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations requiring that dead plant material and weeds with the exception of straw mulch and other organic materials intended to encourage vegetation and retention of moisture in the soil are regularly cleared from the front yardg This section shall not prohibit an association from applying rules and regulations requiring that gardens and crops do not grow more than six feet in height to preserve aesthetic appeal and cleanlinessPortion of the Bill Addressing Tenant Food CultivationApproximately40 of Californians live in residences that they do not own which means that such tenants may have restricted rights to cultivate food depending on what is permitted by the landlord and the lease agreement  This Act would give tenants some rights to cultivate food so long as such cultivation does not unreasonably interfere with existing landscaping or with common area uses by other tenantsDefinitionsCommon area refers to an area of the property that is shared with other tenantsPrivate area refers to an area of the property that is for the exclusive use of a tenantThe Act would protect the ability of tenants to cultivate and sell food as followsa  A landlord shall allow a tenant to participate in Personal Agriculture or Entrepreneurial Agriculture under the following circumstances1Container PlantsA tenant may cultivate food plants in containers so long asA The tenant regularly removes any dead plant material and weedsB The placement of the containers does not interfere with any existing plantsC The placement of the containers does not interfere with any tenants parking spotD The placement of the containers does not create a tripandfall hazardE The placement of the containers does not cause water damage to any portion of the propertyF If the containers are to be placed on top of grass the landlord may require the tenant to replant grass prior to vacating the property2Plants in the Ground or Raised BedsA tenant may cultivate food plants in the ground or in a raised bed so long asA The tenant agrees to restore or pay for the restoration of any landscaping roughly to its original condition when the tenant vacates the property or ceases to engage in food cultivationB The  tenant regularly removes any dead plant material and weeds for the food cultivation areaC The tenant must not leave any hazards in the common area including holes or gardening tools3Impact on Neighbors and Other TenantsA tenant may not engage in gardening activities in any common areas before 700am or after 900pm gardening activities must not interfere with the quiet enjoyment of other residents and neighbors If the landlord determines due to complaints from other residents that the garden area is interfering with the rights of other tenants or neighbors with respect to their quiet enjoyment of the property the landlord may terminate the tenants gardening rights with 30 days written notice The notice must explain the basis for termination of gardening rights Such notice does not constitute a notice of termination of tenancy4Gardening in Common AreasIf the gardening is done in common areas other residents must be notified in writing 15 days prior to the commencement of any food cultivation activity and given an opportunity to bring their concerns to the landlords attention If more than 25 of the tenants object to the gardening activity in the common area and if their concerns are not addressed through a change in the gardening plan then the landlord may prohibit the food cultivation activity in the common area5Restoration of LandscapingWith the exception of container plants on paved areas the landlord may choose to require an additional security deposit to ensure that all landscaping may be restored after the tenant vacates the property or ceases to engage in food cultivation6Payment of Water and Waste Collection BillsA landlord may require the tenant to enter into a written agreement regarding the payment of any excess water and waste collection bills stemming from the garden7Inspection RightsThe landlord has a right to periodically inspect the garden area to ensure compliance with the above rules8OffSite SalesThe landlord may not prevent tenants from selling products derived from this gardening at an offsite

JanelleSELC at gmailcom with your questions and comments Thank youPurposes and SummaryThe purposes of the California Homegrown Food Act are to1 Increase access to fresh locally sourced produce for all Californians regardless of location and other socioeconomic limitations2 Allow individuals to supplement their incomes through sale of produce grown at home or on other urban or suburban land and3 Reduce the carbon footprint of our food system by enabling the increased cultivation of produce in or near places it is consumedThe Act will achieve these purposes by ensuring the rights of individuals and groups to cultivate and in certain cases sell edible plants The Act will remove a handful of barriers arising from local zoning laws private land covenants and lease restrictions ¬†Producers must however still comply with any and all relevant health agricultural and environmental regulations ¬†The Act will specify the types of allowable food production practices and basis for regulation by defining three types of food growing activities and specifying reasonable limits and regulations thereofFindings and DeclarationsThe Legislature finds and declares all of the followinga California industrial agriculture is at risk due to water shortages soil degradation pollution environmental and structural threats to the San Francisco Bay Delta and the rising cost of oil ¬†A food shortage from these problems is a real and imminent threat Providing Californians with the capacity to feed themselves and their communities would drastically improve local food security and mediate the risks of ¬†water soil environmental or fuelrelated crisesb Though California is the bread basket of the United States and has regions of climate and land ideal for agriculture a significant amount of Californias food is grown hundreds or thousands of miles from where it is consumed This results in high transportation costs energy consumption and lost economic opportunity for our state Even food grown in the heart of Californias farming region is expensive to disperse to the rest of the state due to rising fuel costsc California is no exception to rising US obesity and obesityrelated diseases ¬†It is important to note that1 Twothirds of American adults and nearly onethird of American children are obese or overweight putting them at risk for developing chronic diseases such as diabetes heart disease or cancer2 One in every nine California children one in three teens and over half of adults are already overweight or obese This epidemic affects virtually all Californians3 These health conditions are preventable and curable through lifestyle choices that include consumption of healthy fresh foodsd One of every ten dollars spent on health care in the United States goes toward treating diabetes and its complications Facilitating opportunities for California residents to grow and consume fresh healthy foods will promote lifestyles and diets that benefit individuals and communities as well as more effective use of public dollarse Many homeowners associations have rules prohibiting homeowners from growing food in front yards or from selling food grown on the propertyf Additionally approximately 40 of Californians are renters and may as a result of lease restrictions or disapproval by the landlord face limitations on their ability to grow food on the land where they resideg Providing Californians with increased opportunity to participate in smallscale¬†entrepreneurial agriculture will supplement incomes during times of high unemployment and underemployment and stimulate local economiesDefinitionsAs used in this Act the following types of uses shall be defined as followsPersonal AgricultureA use specific to residential zones in which individuals cultivate produce at their own residence for personal consumption or donationCommunity GardenA use in which land managed by a public entity nonprofit organization individual or group of individuals is used to

CultivationApproximately40 of Californians live in residences that they do not own which means that such tenants may have restricted rights to cultivate food depending on what is permitted by the landlord and the lease agreement ¬†This Act would give tenants some rights to cultivate food so long as such cultivation does not unreasonably interfere with existing landscaping or with common area

the gardening is done in common areas other residents must be notified in writing 15 days prior to the commencement of any food cultivation activity and given an opportunity to bring their concerns to the landlords attention If more than 25 of the tenants object to the gardening activity in the common area and if their concerns are not addressed through a change in the gardening plan then the
