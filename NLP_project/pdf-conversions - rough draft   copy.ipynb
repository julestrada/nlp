       "' \\nCOMMUNITY GARDEN START-UP GUIDE \\n \\nBy \\nRachel Surls, UCCE County Director \\nWith Help of Chris Braswell and Laura Harris, Los Angeles Conservation Corps \\nUpdated March 2001 by \\nYvonne Savio, Common Ground Garden Program Manager, UCCE \\n This \"Community Garden Start-Up Guide\" is intended to help neighborhood groups and organizations along the path to starting \\nand sustaining a community garden. \\nWhy Start a Community Garden?  \\n Many families living in the city would like to grow some of their own fruits, vegetables, herbs, and flowers.  Some want to sa ve \\nmoney on their food bills.  Others like the freshness, flavor an d wholesomeness of home-grown produce.  And for many, gardening  is \\na relaxing way to exercise and enjoy being out-of-doors.  There are also families from other cultures who would like to grow \\ntraditional foods not available in the supermarket.  \\n Community gardens beautify neighborhoods and help bring neighbors closer together.  They have been proven as tools to reduce neighborhood crime--particularly when vacant, blighted lots are targeted for garden development.  Community gardens provide saf e, \\nrecreational green space in urban areas with little or no park land, and can contribute greatly  to keeping urban air clean. \\n \\n Those who are lucky enough to have sunny backyards or balconies can plant a garden whenever they  have the time and energy.  \\nBut what about those who do not have a place to garden?  For these people, community gardens may be the answer. \\n \\nStep by Step To Your Own Community Garden  \\n1. Get Your Neighbors Involved  \\nThere is a lot of work involved in starting a new garden.  Make  sure you have several people who will help you.  Over the years , our \\nexperience indicates that there should be at least ten interested families to cr eate and sustain a garden project.  Survey the residents of \\nyour neighborhood to see if they are interested and would participate.  Hold monthly meetings of the interested group to develo p and \\ninitiate plans, keep people posted on the garden\\'s progress, and keep them involved in the process from day one.  \\n2. Form a Garden Club  \\nA garden club is a way of formally organizing your new group.  It helps you make decisions and divide-up the work effectively.  It \\nalso ensures that every one has a vested interest in the garden and can contribute to its design, development, and maintenance.   It can \\nbe formed at any time during the process of  starting a community garden; however, it\\'s wi se to do so early on.  This way, club \\nmembers can share in the many tasks of establishing the new gard en.  The typical garden club will have many functions, includin g: \\n• Establishing garden rules (see sample) \\n• Accepting and reviewing garden applications \\n• Making plot assignments \\n• Collecting garden dues (if any) \\n• Paying water bills \\n• Resolving conflicts \\nThe typical garden club has at least two officers:  a president and a treasurer; although your garden club may have more if nec essary.  \\nElections for garden officers usually are held annually.   \\n \\n 2\\nFind Land for the Garden \\n \\nLook around your neighbor hood for a vacant lo t that gets plenty of sun--at least six to  eight hours each day.  A garden site sh ould be \\nrelatively flat (although slight slopes ca n be terraced).  It should be relatively fr ee of large pieces of concrete left behind  from \\ndemolition of structures.  Any rubble or debris should be manageable--that is, it can be removed by volunteers clearing the lot  with \\ntrash bags, wheelbarrows, and pick up trucks.  Ideally, it should have a fence around it with a gate wide enough for a vehicle to \\nenter.  It is possible to work with a site that is paved with  concrete or asphalt by building raised beds that sit on the surfa ce or using \\ncontainers.  You can also remove the asphalt or concrete to cr eate areas for gardens, but such a garden will be much more diffi cult, \\nexpensive, and time-consuming to start.  A site without pa ving, and soil relatively free of trash and debris is best. \\n \\nThe potential garden site should be within walking, or no more  than a short drive from you and the neighbors who have expressed  \\ninterest in participating.  If the lot is not already being used , make sure the community supports establishing a garden there.  \\n \\nIt\\'s best to select three potential sites in your neighborhood and write down their address and ne arest cross streets.  If you don\\'t know \\nthe address of a vacant lot, get the addresses of the properti es on both sides of the lot--this will give you the ability to ma ke an \\neducated guess on the address of the site.  We suggest you identify at least three potential sites b ecause one or more might no t be \\navailable for you to use for various reasons, and you want to end up with at least one that works out. \\n \\n3. Find out Who Owns the Land \\n \\nIt is illegal to use land without obtaining the owners permission.  In order to obtain permission, you must first find out who owns the \\nland. \\n \\nTake the information you have written down about the location of th e sites in step 3 to your county\\'s tax assessor\\'s office.  T he Los \\nAngeles County Tax Assessor\\'s office is located at 225 North Hill Street, Room 205.  Or go to a branch office listed in the whi te \\npages of the telephone directory.  At this office, you will look  through the map books to get the names and addresses of the ow ner of \\nthe sites you are interested in. \\n \\n4. Find out if Your Proposed Site has Water \\n \\nWhile you are researching site ownership, contact the water servi ce provider in your area to fi nd out if your potential site(s)  \\nhas/have an existing water meter to hook-in to.  Call your water provider\\'s customer service department, and ask them to conduc t a \\n\"site investigation\".  They will need the same location inform ation that you took with you to the Tax Asse ssor\\'s office. \\n \\nExisting access to water will make a critical difference in the expense of getting your project started.  Depending on the size  of your \\ngarden site, you will need a 1/2-inch to 1-inch water meter.  If there has been water service to the site in the past, it is re latively \\ninexpensive to get a new water meter installed (if one doesn\\'t al ready exist).  If there has never been water service to that s ite, it \\nmight cost much more for your water provider to install a lateral line from the street main to the site and install your new me ter. \\n \\n5 Contact the Land Owner \\n \\nOnce you have determined that your potential site is feasible, write a letter to the landowner asking for permission to use the  \\nproperty for a community garden.  Be sure to mention to the landowner the value of the garden to the community and the fact the  \\ngardeners will be responsible for keeping the site clean and weed -free (this saves landowners from maintaining the site or payi ng \\ncity weed abatement fees).  \\nEstablish a term for use of the site, and prepare and negotiate a lease.  Typically, groups lease garden sites from land owners  for $1 \\nper year.  You should attempt to negotiate a lease for a least thr ee years (or longer if the proper ty owner is agreeable).  Man y \\nlandowners are worried about their liability for injuries that mi ght occur at the garden.  Therefore, you should include a simp le \"hold \\nharmless\" waiver in the lease and in gardener agreement forms.  For more information on the lease, and the hold harmless waiver , \\nsee 8, \"Signing a Lease\".  \\nBe prepared to purchase liability insuran ce to protect further the property owner (and  yourself) should an accident occur at th e \\ngarden.  For more information on the hold harmless waiver, and liability insurance, see 8, \"Signing a Lease\", and 9, \"Obtaining  \\nLiability Insurance\". \\n \\n6. Get Your Soil Tested \\n \\nIt might be advisable to have the soil at the site tested for fertility pH and presence of hea vy metals.  Contact a private lab . \\n \\n7. Signing a Lease \\n \\nLandowners of potential garden sites might be concerned abou t their liability should someone be injured while working in the \\ngarden.  Your group should be prepared to offer the landowner a lease with a \"hold harmless\" waiver.  This \"hold harmless\" waiv er \\ncan simply state that should one of the ga rdeners be injured as a result of negligence  on the part of another gardener, the lan downer \\nis \"held harmless\" and will not be sued.  Each gardener should be made aware of this waiver and sh ould be required to sign an \\n 3\\nagreement in order to obtain a plot in the community garden.  A sample gardener agreement form is attached which your \\ngroup can use as a model.  \\n8. Obtaining Liability Insurance \\n \\nLandowners may also require that your group purchase liabilit y insurance.  Community gardeners in the Los Angeles area can \\nobtain inexpensive policies from Metro Farm Gardens.  Contact Toby Leaman at (323) 663-7441 or fax (323) 663-5715, for more \\ninformation on obtaining an insurance policy.  \\nOnce you have a lease signed by the landowner and liability insurance, you\\'re free to plan and plant your garden!  \\n9. Planning the Garden \\n \\nCommunity members should be involved in the planning, design, and set-up of the garden.  Before the design process begins, you \\nshould measure your site and make a simple, to-scale site map.  Hold two or three garden design meetings at times when interest ed \\nparticipants can attend.  Make sure that group decisions are re corded in official minutes, or that someone takes accurate notes .  This \\nensures that decisions made can be communicated to others, and progress will not be slowed.  A great way to generate ideas and \\nvisualize the design is to use simple drawings or photos cut from garden magazines representing the different garden components --\\nflower beds, compost bins, pathways, arbors, etc.--that can be moved around on the map as the group discusses layout.  \\na. Basic Elements of a Community Garden \\n \\nAlthough there are exceptions to every rule, co mmunity gardens should almost always include: \\n \\n• At least 15 plots assigned to community members.  These should be placed in the sunniest part of the garden.  Without plots f or \\nindividual participation, it is very difficult to achieve long-te rm community involvement.  Raised bed plots, which are more \\nexpensive, should be no more than 4 feet wide (to facilitate access to plants from the sides w ithout stepping into the bed), an d \\nbetween 8 and 12 feet long (it is advisable to construct your ra ised beds in sizes that are found in readily-available lumber, or that \\ncan be cut without too much waste).  In-ground plots can be from 10 x 10 up to 20 x 20 feet.  Pathways between beds and plots \\nshould be least 3 to 4 feet wide to allow space for wheelbarrows.  The soil in both raised bed and in-ground plots should be \\namended with aged compost or manure to improve its fertility and increase its organic matter content. \\n \\n• A simple irrigation system with one hose bib or faucet for every four plots.  Hand watering with a hose is the most practical  and \\naffordable for individual plots (and it\\'s al most a necessity when you start plants from  seed).  Drip and soaker-hose irrigation  can be \\nused in all areas of the garden for transplanted and establishe d plants, but especially for deep -rooted fruit trees and ornamen tals.  If \\nno one in your group is knowledgeable about irrigation, you might need some assistance in designing your irrigation system.  Se ek \\nout a landscape contractor or nursery or garden center professional to help you develop a basic layout and materials list. \\n \\n• An 8-foot fence around the perimeter with a drive-through gate .  In our experience, this is a key element of success.  Don\\'t \\ncount on eliminating all acts of vandalism or theft, but fencing will help to keep these to tolerably low levels.  \\n• A tool shed or other structure for storing tools, supplies, and materials.  Recycled metal shipping containers make excellent  \\nstorage sheds, and are almost vandal-proof.  Contact the Port Authority for leads on where to find them. \\n \\n• A bench or picnic table where gardeners can sit, relax, and take  a break--preferably in shade.  If there are no shade trees o n the \\nsite, a simple arbor can be constructed from wood or pipe, and planted with chayote squash, bougainvillea, grapes, kiwis, or so me \\nother vine.  \\n• A sign with the garden\\'s name, sponsors, and a contact person\\'s phone number for more information.  If your community is bilingual, include information in this language. \\n \\n• A shared composting area for the community  gardeners.  Wood pallets are easy to come-by and (when stood on-end, attached \\nin a U-shape, and the inside covered with galvanized rabbit-wire) make excellent compost bins.  \\nb. Nice Additions to Your Garden Plan \\n \\n• A small fruit tree orchard, whose care and harvest can be shared  by all the members.  The or chard can also create shade for \\npeople as well as shade-loving plants. \\n \\n• A water fountain.  This can be a simple drinking fountain attachment to a hose bib (or faucet) you can purchase at a hardware  \\nstore.  \\n• Perimeter landscaping, which can focus on drought tolerant  flowers and shrubs, plants which attract butterflies and \\nhummingbirds, or roses and other flowers suitable for cutting bou quets.  Herbs are also well-suited to perimeter landscaping an d \\nhelp to create barriers to unwanted pest insects who do not like the smell of their essential oils. \\n \\n• A children\\'s area, which can include special small pl ots for children, a sand box, and play equipment. \\n \\n• A meeting area, which could range from a semi-circle of hay ba les or tree stumps, to a simple amphitheater built of recycled,  \\nbroken concrete.  Building a shade struct ure above would be beneficial as well. \\n 4\\n \\n• A community bulletin board where rules, meeting notices, and other important information can be posted. \\n \\n10. Creating a Garden Budget  \\nUse your design to develop a materials list and cost-out the pr oject.  You will need to call-around to get prices on fencing an d other \\nitems.  You might be surprised at the cost.  A community garden with just the Basic Elements (listed above) typically costs bet ween \\n$2,500 to $5,000.  At this point, your group might decide to scale back your initial plans and save some design ideas for a \"Ph ase \\nTwo\" of the garden. \\n \\n11. Where to Get Materials and Money  \\nWhile some start-up funds will be needed through determination and hard work, you can obtain donations of materials for your project.  Community businesses might assist, and provide anything from fencing to lumber to plants.  The important thing is to ask.  \\nDevelop a letter that tells merchants about your project and why it\\'s important to the community.  Attach your \"wish list\", but  be \\nreasonable.  Try to personalize this letter for each business you approach.  Drop it off personally with the store manager, pre ferably \\nwith a couple of cute kids who will be gard ening in tow!  Then, follow-up by phone.  Be patient, persistent, and polite.  Your efforts \\nwill pay-off with at least some of the businesses you approach.  Be sure to thank these key supporters and recognize them on yo ur \\ngarden sign, at a garden grand opening, or other special event. \\n \\nMoney, which will be needed to purchase items not donated, can be  obtained through community fund-raisers such as car washes, \\ncraft and rummage sales, pancake breakfasts, and bake sales.  They can also be  obtained by writing grants, but be aware grant \\nwriting efforts can take six months or longer to yield results, an d you must have a fiscal sponsor or agent with tax-exempt 501 (c)3 \\nstatus (such as a church or non-profit corporation) that agrees to administer the funds. \\n \\n12. Make Sure Your Garden Infrastructure is in Place  \\nIf you have not yet formed a garden club, now is the time to do so.  It\\'s also time to establish garden rules, develop a garden  \\napplication form for those who wish to participate, set up a bank account, and determine what garden dues will be if these thin gs \\nhave not already been done.  This is also the time to begin having monthly meetings if you have not already done so.  Also, if you \\nhaven\\'t already contacted your city councilperson, he or she can be helpful in many ways including helping your group obtain ci ty \\nservices such as trash pick-up.  Their staff can also help you with community organizing and soliciting for material donations.  \\n \\n13.   Get Growing!  \\nMany new garden groups make the mistake of remaining in the planning, design and fundraising stage for an extended period of \\ntime.  There is a fine line between planning well and over plan ning.  After several months of the initial research, designing, \\nplanning, and outreach efforts, group members will very like ly be feeling frustrated and will begin to wonder if all their effo rts will \\never result in a garden.  That\\'s why it\\'s important to plant something on your site as soon as possible.  People need to see vi sible \\nresults or they will begin to lose interest in the project.  To keep the momentum going, initiate the following steps even if y ou are \\nstill seeking donations and funds or your project (but not until you have signed a lease and obtained insurance).  \\na. Clean up the Site \\nSchedule community workdays to clean up the site.  How many work days you need will depend on the size of the site, and how \\nmuch and what kind of debris are on site.   \\n \\nb. Install the Irrigation System \\nWithout water, you can\\'t grow anything.  So get this key element into place as soon as possible.  There are plenty of opportuni ties \\nfor community involvement--from digging trenches to laying out PVC pipes. \\n \\nc. Plant Something \\nOnce you have water, there are many options for in-garden action.  Stake out beds and pathways by marking them with stakes and \\ntwine.  Mulch pathways.  If your fence is n\\'t in yet, some people might still want to accept the risk of vandalism and get their  plots \\nstarted.  You can also plant shade and fruit trees and begin to landscape the site.  If you do not yet have a source of donated  plants, \\nor don\\'t wish to risk having them vandalized, plant annual flower  seeds which will grow quickly and can be replaced later.  See ds \\nfor Los Angeles County community and school gardens can be obtained through the Common Ground Garden Program (323) 260-\\n3348.  \\nd. Continue to construct the garden as  materials and funds become available. \\n \\n14. Celebrate!  \\nAt this point, your ideas and hard work have finally become a community garden!  Be sure to take time to celebrate.  Have a gra nd \\nopening, barbecue, or some other fun event to give everyone who helped to make this happen, a special thank-you.  This is the t ime \\nto give all those who gave donated materials or time a sp ecial certificate, bouquet, or other form of recognition. \\n \\n15. Troubleshooting as the Garden Develops  \\n 5\\nAll community gardens will experience problems somewhere along  the way.  Don\\'t get discourage--get organized.  The key \\nto success for community gardens is not only preventing problems from ever occurring, but also working together to solve them \\nwhen they do inevitably occur.  In our experience, these are some of the most common problems that \"crop-up\" in community \\ngardens, and our suggestions for solving them  \\na. Vandalism \\nMost gardens experience occasional vandalism.  The best action you can take is to replant immediately.  Generally the vandals \\nbecome bored after a while and st op.  Good community outr each, especially to youth and the ga rden\\'s immediately neighbors is al so \\nimportant.  Most important--don\\'t get to discouraged.  It happens.  Get over it and keep going.  What about barbed wired or raz or \\nwire to make the garden more secure?  Our advice--don\\'t.  It\\'s  bad for community relations, looks awful, and is sometimes illeg al to \\ninstall without a permit.  If you need more physical deterrents to keep vandals out, plant bougainvillea or pyracantha along yo ur \\nfence, their thorns will do the trick!  \\nb. Security \\nInvite the community officer from your local precinct to a garden meeting to get their suggestions on making the garden more \\nsecure.  Community officers can also be a great help in solving problems with garden vandalism, and dealing with drug dealers, and \\ngang members in the area.  \\nc. Communication \\nClear and well-enforced garden rules and a strong garden president can go a long way towards minimizing misunderstandings in th e \\ngarden.  But communication problems do arise.  It\\'s the job of the garden club to resolve those issues.  If it\\'s something not clearly \\nspelled out in the rules, the membership can take a vote to add new rules and make modifications to existing rules.  \\nLanguage barriers are a very common source of misunderstandings.  Garden club leadership should make every effort to have a \\ntranslator at garden meetings where partic ipants are bilingual--perhaps a family member  of one of the garden members who speaks  \\nthe language will offer to help.  \\nd. Trash \\nIt\\'s important to get your compost system going right away and get some training for gardeners on how to use it.  If gardeners don\\'t \\ncompost, large quantities of waste will begin to build up, create an eyesore, and could hurt your  relationships with neighbors and the \\nproperty owner.  Waste can also become a fire hazard.  Make su re gardeners know how to sort trash properly, what to compost, an d \\nwhat to recycle.  Trash cans placed in accessible areas are helpful to keep  a neat and tidy garden. \\n \\ne. Gardener Drop-Out \\nThere has been, and probably always will be, a high rate of turn over in community gardens.  Often, people sign up for plots and  \\nthen don\\'t follow through.  Remember, gardening is hard work for so me people, especially in the heat  of summer.  Be sure to hav e a \\nclause in your gardener agreement which stat es gardeners forfeit their right to their plot if they don\\'t plant it within one mo nth, or if \\nthey don\\'t maintain it.  While gardeners should be given ever y opportunity to follow through, if after several reminders either  by \\nletter or phone nothing changes, it is time for the club to reassi gn the plot.  It is also advi sable that every year, the leade rship \\nconduct a renewed community outreach campaig n by contacting churches and other groups in the neighborhood to let them know \\nabout the garden and that  plots are available.  \\nf. Weeds \\nGardeners tend to visit their plots less during the winter time, and lower participation, combined with rain, tends to create a  huge \\nweed problem in January, February, and March.   Remember, part of your agreement with  the landowner is that you will maintain \\nthe lot and keep weeds from taking over.  In the late summer/ear ly fall, provide gardeners with a workshop or printed material about \\nwhat can be grown in a fall and winter garden.  Also, schedule garden workdays for the spring in advance since you know you\\'ll \\nneed them at the end of winter to clear weeds.  If you anticip ate that plots will be untended during the winter, apply a thick layer of \\nmulch or hay to the beds and paths to reduce weed proliferation.  \\nGood luck with your community garden project!   \\nYvonne Savio, Common Ground Garden Program Manager, University of California Cooperative Extension, Los Angeles County \\n4800 E.
